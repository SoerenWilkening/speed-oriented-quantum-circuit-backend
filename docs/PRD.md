# Quantum Assembly — Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Vision

Quantum Assembly is a Python framework that enables developers to write quantum algorithms using familiar programming constructs — arithmetic operators, comparisons, conditionals — without ever touching quantum gates. The framework compiles this high-level code into optimized quantum circuits automatically.

**Next milestone**: Extend the framework to solve classical two-player perfect-information games (chess) using quantum walk-based minimax tree evaluation, achieving a quadratic speedup over classical approaches.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 The Algorithm Verification Problem

Quantum algorithms that operate on real-world problem sizes (e.g., chess board evaluation) require hundreds or thousands of qubits. Classical simulation of quantum circuits is limited to ~17 qubits before becoming impractical. This creates a fundamental gap: **we cannot verify the correctness of the algorithms we write**.

Without a verification mechanism, developing complex quantum algorithms is effectively blind — bugs in predicates, move generation, or walk operators cannot be detected until real quantum hardware is available at sufficient scale.

### 2.2 The Algorithm Complexity Problem

Quantum algorithms for game tree evaluation exist in the literature (Montanaro 2015, Farhi/Gutmann 2007) but have never been implemented in a practical programming framework. The gap between theoretical descriptions and working code is significant: encoding game states, generating legal moves, constructing walk operators with variable branching, and composing these into a full minimax solver all require careful engineering.

## 3. Users

### 3.1 Primary User

Quantum algorithm researchers and developers who use the Quantum Assembly framework to design, implement, and test quantum algorithms.

### 3.2 User Expectations

- Write algorithm code once; it works in both quantum execution and classical verification modes without modification.
- Verify algorithm correctness at scale through classical sampling, with statistical confidence.
- Build complex quantum algorithms (game solvers) from composable, testable components.

## 4. Requirements

### P0 — Must Have

#### R1: Classical Verification Mode

The framework must support a classical execution mode where quantum algorithm code runs on concrete integer values without generating any quantum circuit.

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R1.1 | A framework-level API activates classical mode (e.g., context manager). User algorithm code is unchanged. |
| R1.2 | In classical mode, `qint` operations perform Python integer arithmetic with width-correct semantics (bit masking/truncation). |
| R1.3 | In classical mode, `qbool` context managers (`with` blocks) behave as classical `if` statements. |
| R1.4 | In classical mode, `qarray` operations perform element-wise classical computation. |
| R1.5 | Superposition points (Hadamard, branching) are replaced by random sampling with correct probabilities. |
| R1.6 | Classical mode does not allocate qubits, emit gates, or construct circuits. |
| R1.7 | The verification mode supports repeated runs (N samples) for statistical confidence. |

A complete quantum walk-based game solver for tic-tac-toe, serving as proof-of-concept and verification benchmark.

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R2.1 | Board state encoding using quantum registers (9 cells, 3 states each). |
| R2.2 | Move legality predicate: cell is empty, correct player's turn, game not over. |
| R2.3 | Win detection predicate: three-in-a-row for either player. |
| R2.4 | Legal move counting: quantum integer holding the number of valid moves. |
| R2.5 | Walk operator with conditional diffusion restricted to valid children only. |
| R2.6 | All predicates verifiable via classical verification mode (R1). |
| R2.7 | Late-game positions (2-3 empty cells) verifiable via quantum simulation within 17-qubit limit. |

#### R3: Walk Operator Correctness

The quantum walk operators must produce only legal game states.

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R3.1 | Walk operator enumerates candidate moves, evaluates legality, counts valid moves, and diffuses only over valid children. |
| R3.2 | Conditional diffusion applies rotation angles parameterized by the valid move count `k`. |
| R3.3 | All intermediate computations (legality flags, move count) are properly uncomputed. |
| R3.4 | Walk operators are verifiable via classical verification mode (property: no illegal moves generated, correct move counts). |

A structured API for defining and running verification checks.

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R6.1 | API for specifying an algorithm, a property to check, and a sample count. |
| R6.2 | Aggregated reporting: pass/fail counts, failure examples, confidence level. |
| R6.3 | Integration with standard testing frameworks (pytest). |

### P2 — Nice to Have

#### R7: Circuit Compilation Improvements

Reduce memory footprint of circuit representation.

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| R7.1 | Call graph-based instruction storage instead of full gate lists. |
| R7.2 | Complete and working optimization flags (`opt=0`, `opt=1`, `opt=2`). |

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Classical mode misses bugs that only manifest in superposition | Medium | High | Complement with small-instance quantum simulation; test walk operators on tiny graphs |
| Walk operator with variable branching introduces subtle phase errors | Medium | High | Formal verification of rotation angles; cross-check with known small-instance results |
| Chess encoding requires too many qubits for any meaningful quantum simulation | High | Medium | Rely entirely on classical verification; validate approach on tic-tac-toe first |
| Performance overhead of classical mode flag check in quantum mode | Low | Low | Single boolean check per operation; benchmark to confirm negligible impact |
| Existing codebase issues (Tasks 1-2) block progress on Tasks 3 and 5 | Low | Medium | Tasks are independent; address blocking issues as encountered |
