## Current Focus

hypothesis: CONFIRMED and FIXED - _simulate_qasm() now includes circuit.measure_all() when no classical registers present
test: Ran pytest tests/python/test_branch_superposition.py -v
expecting: All 31 tests pass
next_action: Archive session

## Symptoms

expected: Tests pass -- _simulate_qasm() returns counts dict with qubit measurement results
actual: qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError: 'No counts for experiment "0"' -- 28/31 tests fail
errors: QiskitError 'No counts for experiment "0"' at result.get_counts()
reproduction: Run pytest tests/python/test_branch_superposition.py
started: After fixing ql.openqasm() -> ql.to_openqasm() naming issue

## Eliminated

## Evidence

- timestamp: 2026-02-20T00:01:00Z
  checked: c_backend/src/circuit_output.c lines 535-602 (circuit_to_qasm_string)
  found: QASM export only includes `measure` instructions if explicit M gates exist in circuit. It counts measurements first (_count_measurements), only declares `bit[N] c;` if count > 0, and only emits `c[i] = measure q[j];` for Gate == M.
  implication: The branch() method emits Ry gates only -- no measurement gates are added to the circuit. The QASM output will have no measure instructions.

- timestamp: 2026-02-20T00:02:00Z
  checked: src/quantum_language/qint.pyx lines 765-785 (qint.measure method)
  found: The measure() method is a simulation placeholder that just returns self.value. It does NOT emit a measurement gate (Gate == M) into the circuit.
  implication: There is no Python API to emit measurement gates into the circuit for QASM export.

- timestamp: 2026-02-20T00:03:00Z
  checked: tests/python/test_branch_superposition.py lines 35-41 (_simulate_qasm function)
  found: Function loads QASM via qiskit.qasm3.loads(), transpiles, runs with 8192 shots, then calls result.get_counts(). It does NOT add measurements to the loaded circuit.
  implication: Without measurements, Qiskit Aer has no classical bits to report -- get_counts() raises QiskitError.

- timestamp: 2026-02-20T00:04:00Z
  checked: tests/python/test_cross_backend.py lines 160-194 (_simulate_and_extract function)
  found: This WORKING helper has the fix: `if not circuit.cregs: circuit.measure_all()` on lines 175-176. It checks whether the loaded QASM circuit has classical registers; if not, it adds measure_all() to measure every qubit before running.
  implication: This is the established pattern in the codebase for handling QASM circuits that lack measurement instructions. The test_branch_superposition.py helper was not written with this pattern.

- timestamp: 2026-02-26T00:00:00Z
  checked: Fix verification - ran pytest tests/python/test_branch_superposition.py -v
  found: All 31/31 tests pass. The fix (lines 36-37 of test_branch_superposition.py) was already applied in an earlier session. Zero failures across all test classes: TestBranchEqualSuperposition (8), TestBranchProbabilities (7), TestBranchQbool (1), TestBranchIndexed (2), TestBranchControlled (1), TestBranchCompile (1), TestBranchValidation (3), TestBranchAccumulation (1), TestInternalGates (7).
  implication: Fix is verified. The root cause is fully resolved.

## Resolution

root_cause: _simulate_qasm() in test_branch_superposition.py (line 35-41) does not add measurement instructions to the Qiskit circuit before simulation. The QASM output from ql.to_openqasm() contains only gate operations (Ry, H, Z, etc.) with no measure instructions, because the C backend only emits `measure` for explicit M gates in the circuit, and branch()/emit_h()/emit_z()/emit_mcz() do not add M gates. Without measurements, Qiskit Aer's result.get_counts() has no classical data to return, raising QiskitError "No counts for experiment 0".
fix: Added `if not circuit.cregs: circuit.measure_all()` to _simulate_qasm() on lines 36-37, matching the established pattern from test_cross_backend.py's _simulate_and_extract().
verification: All 31/31 tests pass in test_branch_superposition.py (previously 28 failed, 3 passed). Fix was already applied in an earlier session.
