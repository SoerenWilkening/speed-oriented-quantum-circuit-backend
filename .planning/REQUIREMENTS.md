# Requirements: Quantum Assembly

**Defined:** 2026-02-22
**Core Value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.

## v4.1 Requirements

Requirements for v4.1 Quality & Efficiency milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Bug Fixes

- [ ] **BUG-01**: Fix 32-bit multiplication segfault (buffer overflow in C backend)
- [ ] **BUG-02**: Fix qarray `*=` in-place multiplication segfault
- [x] **BUG-03**: Fix qiskit_aer undeclared dependency (add to pyproject.toml verification group, add friendly ImportError message)
- [ ] **BUG-04**: Fix mixed-width QFT addition off-by-one (BUG-WIDTH-ADD)
- [ ] **BUG-05**: Fix QFT controlled QQ addition CCP rotation errors at width 2+ (BUG-CQQ-QFT)
- [ ] **BUG-06**: Fix MSB comparison leak in division (BUG-DIV-02, 9 cases per div/mod test file)
- [ ] **BUG-07**: Fix controlled multiplication scope uncomputation corruption (BUG-COND-MUL-01)
- [ ] **BUG-08**: Fix QFT division/modulo pervasive failures at all tested widths (BUG-QFT-DIV)
- [ ] **BUG-09**: Fix _reduce_mod result corruption (BUG-MOD-REDUCE) or explicitly defer with documented rationale

### Tech Debt

- [ ] **DEBT-01**: Remove dead QPU.c/QPU.h stubs and all references across C/Cython/Python layers
- [ ] **DEBT-02**: Automate qint_preprocessed.pyx generation with build-time sync and CI drift check
- [ ] **DEBT-03**: Remove duplicate/dead code identified by vulture scan (unused Python functions, unreachable code)
- [ ] **DEBT-04**: Document hardcoded sequence generation process and regeneration instructions

### Security & Hardening

- [ ] **SEC-01**: Add circuit pointer validation at all Cython boundary entry points (prevent unsafe casts in _core.pyx)
- [ ] **SEC-02**: Add qubit_array bounds checking before writes to scratch buffer (prevent silent buffer overrun)
- [ ] **SEC-03**: Run cppcheck static analysis on C backend and fix all HIGH severity findings

### Performance

- [ ] **PERF-01**: Fix optimizer latent loop direction bug (++i should be --i in smallest_layer_below_comp)
- [ ] **PERF-02**: Replace optimizer linear scan with binary search for gate placement (O(L) to O(log L))
- [ ] **PERF-03**: Reduce @ql.compile replay overhead (profile gate injection, optimize dict iteration)

### Binary Size

- [ ] **SIZE-01**: Apply section garbage collection compiler flags (-ffunction-sections, -fdata-sections, --gc-sections)
- [ ] **SIZE-02**: Strip symbols from release builds (-s link flag or post-build strip)
- [ ] **SIZE-03**: Evaluate -Os vs -O3 for sequence files with benchmark verification (no performance regression)

### Test Coverage

- [x] **TEST-01**: Add pytest-cov infrastructure with Cython coverage plugin and coverage config in pyproject.toml
- [x] **TEST-02**: Measure baseline coverage and identify critical untested paths
- [ ] **TEST-03**: Add tests for nested with-blocks (quantum conditionals within quantum conditionals)
- [ ] **TEST-04**: Add tests for circuit reset behavior (circuit state after reset_circuit)
- [ ] **TEST-05**: Integrate C backend tests (test_allocator_block, test_reverse_circuit) into pytest via subprocess wrapper
- [ ] **TEST-06**: Convert xfail markers to passing tests for all bugs fixed in this milestone

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future milestones. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Parametric Compilation
- **PAR-01**: Compile once for all classical values
- **PAR-02**: Parametric gate sequences

### Advanced Compilation
- **ADV-01**: Resource estimation for compiled functions
- **ADV-02**: Serialization of compiled functions to disk
- **ADV-03**: Compiled function composition

### Advanced Optimization
- **ADV-OPT-01**: Hardcoded sequences for multiplication (EVAL-01 recommends "investigate")
- **ADV-OPT-03**: SIMD vectorization for bulk gate operations
- **ADV-OPT-04**: Multi-threaded circuit building

### Fault-Tolerant Features
- **OPT-01**: Automatic depth/ancilla tradeoff (RCA vs CLA selection)
- **FTE-02**: Modular arithmetic via Toffoli gates (for Shor's algorithm)

### Grover/Search Extensions
- **GADV-01**: Quantum counting (`ql.count_solutions`) for exact M estimation
- **GADV-02**: Fixed-point amplitude amplification
- **GADV-03**: Custom state preparation (non-uniform initial superposition)
- **GSPEC-01**: SAT/3-SAT oracle auto-generation from CNF formulas
- **GSPEC-02**: Database search oracle from classical data structure

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Parallel test execution (pytest-xdist) | Global circuit state makes parallel tests produce corrupt circuits |
| Full type checking (mypy) | 60K lines of Cython unsupported by mypy; massive stub effort |
| Fuzz testing harness | Valuable but separate project; needs dedicated harness design |
| Refactoring global circuit state | Foundational architecture change; too large for quality milestone |
| Kogge-Stone CLA implementation | Stubs exist but feature addition, not quality work |
| Controlled bitwise operations | Feature addition, not quality work |
| GUI/interactive debugging | Complex infrastructure beyond quality scope |
