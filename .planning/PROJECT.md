# Quantum Assembly

## What This Is

A quantum programming framework that enables writing quantum algorithms using standard programming constructs — operator overloading on variable-width quantum integers (qint, 1-64 bits) and quantum booleans (qbool), with Python's `with` statement implementing quantum conditionals. Operations compile to optimized quantum circuits via a C backend with Cython bindings. Includes `@ql.compile` for function-level compilation with gate capture/replay/optimization, circuit optimization, pixel-art circuit visualization scaling to 200+ qubits, statistics, OpenQASM 3.0 export, and Qiskit-based verification.

## Core Value

Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.

### Active

**Deferred bugs (carry forward):**
- Fix _reduce_mod result corruption (BUG-MOD-REDUCE) — needs fundamentally different circuit structure
- Fix controlled multiplication corruption (BUG-COND-MUL-01) — not yet investigated
- Fix MSB comparison leak in division (BUG-DIV-02) — 9 cases per div/mod test file
- Fix mixed-width QFT addition off-by-one (BUG-WIDTH-ADD) — discovered in Phase 43

**Deferred features (carry forward):**
- Parametric compilation (compile once for all classical values) — PAR-01, PAR-02
- Resource estimation for compiled functions — ADV-01
- Serialization of compiled functions to disk — ADV-02
- Compiled function composition — ADV-03

### Out of Scope

- Direct/immediate execution mode — future direction, keep circuit compilation approach
- Hardware integration — OpenQASM export handles most cases
- ML framework integration — requires stable API first, complex integration
- Real-time debugging — complex infrastructure requirement
- GUI interface — programmatic API sufficient (pixel-art visualization is image output, not interactive GUI)
- Direct quantum state access — violates no-cloning theorem
- Automatic qubit cloning — physically impossible

## Context

**Architecture:** Three-layer stateless design — C backend (gate primitives, circuit management, integer operations) -> Cython bindings -> Python frontend (qint/qbool classes, operator overloading). All functions take explicit parameters; no global state.

**Current state:** v2.1 shipped — compile enhancements complete. `@ql.compile` now supports ancilla tracking with forward call registry, `f.inverse(x)` for uncomputing/deallocating exact physical ancillas from prior forward calls, `f.adjoint(x)` for standalone adjoint generation, auto-uncompute in qubit_saving mode, and `ql.qarray` arguments. 106 compilation tests. Pixel-art circuit visualization with two zoom levels scaling to 200+ qubits. Exhaustive verification suite with 8,365+ tests covering every operation category through the full pipeline (Python -> C circuit -> OpenQASM 3.0 -> Qiskit simulate -> result check). Clean modular C backend with types.h, circuit.h, arithmetic_ops.h, comparison_ops.h, bitwise_ops.h, circuit_output.h. Centralized qubit allocator with ownership tracking. Variable-width quantum integers (1-64 bits) with complete arithmetic, comparison, and initialization operations. Automatic uncomputation with dependency tracking, mode control (lazy/eager), and user override methods. Proper package structure with ql.array supporting multi-dimensional arrays, reductions, element-wise operations, and in-place element mutation. CNOT-based quantum copy for binary operations. Memory-safe Python-to-C bridge with Cython try-finally cleanup.

**Codebase:**
- ~345,901 lines of code (Python, Cython, C)
- Version 0.1.0
- Tech stack: Python 3.11+, Cython, C backend, Qiskit (optional verification)

**Performance:** Benchmarks in `circuit-gen-results/` demonstrate speed and memory superiority over Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, and other backends for QFT circuits up to 2000 variables.

**Documentation:**
- README.md with Quick Start, API Reference, Examples
- NumPy-style Python docstrings
- Doxygen-style C header documentation
- Codebase analysis in `.planning/codebase/`

**Target audience:** Open source quantum computing community.

**Known limitations:**
- qint_mod * qint_mod raises NotImplementedError (by design)
- apply_merge() placeholder for future phase rotation merging
- Nested quantum conditionals require quantum-quantum AND implementation (future work)
- _reduce_mod result corruption (BUG-MOD-REDUCE) — needs different circuit structure for larger moduli
- Controlled multiplication corrupts result register (BUG-COND-MUL-01) — not yet investigated
- MSB comparison leak in division (BUG-DIV-02) — 9 cases per div/mod test file
- Dirty ancilla from widened comparisons (gt/le) — known limitation, not a correctness bug
- Mixed-width QFT addition off-by-one (BUG-WIDTH-ADD) — discovered in v1.8
- Layer-based uncomputation tracking unreliable when optimizer parallelizes gates — future: use instruction counter

## Constraints

- **Architecture**: Keep `add_gate` circuit-building approach; direct execution is future work
- **Compatibility**: Maintain Python API compatibility in future versions
