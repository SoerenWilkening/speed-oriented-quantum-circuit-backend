# Quantum Assembly

## What This Is

A quantum programming framework that enables writing quantum algorithms using standard programming constructs — operator overloading on variable-width quantum integers (qint, 1-64 bits) and quantum booleans (qbool), with Python's `with` statement implementing quantum conditionals. Operations compile to optimized quantum circuits via a C backend with Cython bindings. Includes circuit optimization, visualization, and statistics.

## Core Value

Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.

### Active

**Milestone v1.2: Automatic Uncomputation**

**Goal:** Automatically uncompute intermediate qubits in boolean expressions when their lifetime ends.

**Target features:**
- Dependency tracking for qbool expressions (track what intermediates created a result)
- Auto-uncomputation when final qbool lifetime ends (scope exit, explicit uncompute)
- Cascading cleanup through dependency graph (uncompute intermediates in reverse order)
- Qubit-saving mode option (`ql.option("qubit_saving")`) for immediate intermediate cleanup
- Support for both qbool operations and qint comparison results

### Out of Scope

- Direct/immediate execution mode — future direction, keep circuit compilation approach
- Hardware integration — OpenQASM export handles most cases
- ML framework integration — requires stable API first, complex integration
- Real-time debugging — complex infrastructure requirement
- GUI interface — programmatic API sufficient
- Direct quantum state access — violates no-cloning theorem
- Automatic qubit cloning — physically impossible

## Context

**Architecture:** Three-layer stateless design — C backend (gate primitives, circuit management, integer operations) → Cython bindings → Python frontend (qint/qbool classes, operator overloading). All functions take explicit parameters; no global state.

**Current state:** v1.1 shipped. Clean modular C backend with types.h, circuit.h, arithmetic_ops.h, comparison_ops.h, bitwise_ops.h. Centralized qubit allocator with ownership tracking. Variable-width quantum integers (1-64 bits) with complete arithmetic, comparison, and initialization operations.

**Codebase:**
- ~70,900 lines of code (Python, Cython, C)
- Version 0.1.0
- Tech stack: Python 3.11+, Cython, C backend

**Performance:** Benchmarks in `circuit-gen-results/` demonstrate speed and memory superiority over Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, and other backends for QFT circuits up to 2000 variables.

**Documentation:**
- README.md with Quick Start, API Reference, Examples
- NumPy-style Python docstrings
- Doxygen-style C header documentation
- Codebase analysis in `.planning/codebase/`

**Target audience:** Open source quantum computing community.

**Known limitations:**
- qint_mod * qint_mod raises NotImplementedError (by design)
- apply_merge() placeholder for future phase rotation merging
- Multiplication tests segfault at certain widths (C backend issue, pre-existing)

## Constraints

- **Architecture**: Keep `add_gate` circuit-building approach; direct execution is future work
- **Compatibility**: Maintain Python API compatibility in future versions
- **Performance**: Circuit generation must remain efficient for large circuits

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Bottom-up restructuring (C first) | Foundation must be solid before adding features | ✓ Good — clean modular C backend |
| Open source release target | Requires clean code, docs, tests | ✓ Good — v1.0 shipped |
| Keep circuit compilation model | Direct execution is future; current approach works | ✓ Good — works well |
| types.h as foundation module | Single source of truth for shared types | ✓ Good — clean dependencies |
| Right-aligned qubit array layout | Supports variable-width with minimal changes | ✓ Good — 1-64 bits work |
| MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE for QQ_mul | Original formula underestimated layer needs | ⚠️ Revisit — may need optimization |
| Single README format | GitHub-rendered, accessible without build | ✓ Good — easy to maintain |
| Stateless C backend | Global state eliminated for cleaner architecture | ✓ Good — v1.1 complete |
| Multi-controlled gates via large_control | Supports n-controlled X without ancilla qubits | ✓ Good — efficient for comparisons |
| In-place comparison pattern | Subtract-add-back preserves operands without temp allocation | ✓ Good — memory efficient |
| Auto-width qint initialization | qint(5) calculates minimum bits automatically | ✓ Good — user-friendly API |
