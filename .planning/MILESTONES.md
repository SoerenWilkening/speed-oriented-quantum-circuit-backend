# Project Milestones: Quantum Assembly

## v2.1 Compile Enhancements (Shipped: 2026-02-05)

**Delivered:** Ancilla qubit reuse in compiled function inverses (track, uncompute, deallocate), auto-uncompute in qubit_saving mode, and `ql.qarray` support as `@ql.compile` arguments.

**Phases completed:** 52-54 (6 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Forward call registry tracks ancilla qubits allocated during compiled function execution

- `f.adjoint(x)` provides standalone adjoint without forward call tracking
- Auto-uncompute of temp ancillas when `qubit_saving` mode is active (preserves return qubits)
- `ql.qarray` support in `@ql.compile` with correct capture, cache keying by length, and replay
- 106 compilation tests (100% pass rate) covering all INV and ARR requirements

**Stats:**
