# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** Phase 94 — Parametric Compilation (IN PROGRESS)

## Current Position

Phase: 94 of 94 (Parametric Compilation) — fifth phase of v5.0
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Plan 02 complete, Plan 03 next
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — Plan 02 complete (parametric probe/replay lifecycle)

Progress: [██████----] 67% (2/3 Phase 94 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 258 (v1.0-v4.1)
- Average duration: ~13 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~43.3 hours

| v5.0 Advanced Arithmetic | 90-94 | ? | In progress |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward (architectural):**
- BUG-DIV-02/BUG-QFT-DIV — FIXED in Phase 91 (C-level restoring divmod)
- BUG-MOD-REDUCE — PARTIALLY FIXED in Phase 91 (leak reduced from n+1 to 1 qubit per mod_reduce call; QQ division and mod_reduce still have persistent ancilla when reduction triggers)
- Parametric Toffoli CQ limitation — value-dependent gate topology requires per-value fallback (RESOLVED in Phase 94 — auto-detected and documented)
- Research flags: Phase 92 (HIGH risk — Beauregard ancilla layout) — Phase 94 MEDIUM-HIGH risk resolved via two-capture probe

### Decisions (Phase 94)

- Cache key includes (arithmetic_mode, cla_override, tradeoff_policy) tuple appended to all 4 key construction sites
- Oracle decorator forces parametric=False since oracle parameters are structural by nature
- Parametric-safe fast path captures per-value on cache miss (simplest correct approach) rather than reconstructing from template
- Defensive topology check on every new classical value guards against runtime divergence
- _reset_for_circuit preserves parametric probe state across circuit resets; clear_cache does full reset

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-25
Stopped at: Completed 94-02-PLAN.md
Resume action: Execute 94-03-PLAN.md (parametric compilation verification tests)
