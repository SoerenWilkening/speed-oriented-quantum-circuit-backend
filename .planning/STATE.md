# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** v7.0 Compile Infrastructure -- Phase 107 ready to plan

## Current Position

Phase: 107 of 110 (Call Graph DAG Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Phase 107 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-05 -- Completed 107-02 compile DAG integration (opt param, 43 tests)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 277 (v1.0-v6.1)
- Average duration: ~13 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~45.7 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Call graph DAG lives in Python (compile-time structure, not hot path)
- opt_flag=1 builds DAG alongside normal expansion (no C backend changes)
- rustworkx PyDAG for graph primitives, NumPy bitmasks for qubit overlap
- Sparse circuit arrays deferred to v8.0 (independent C-level track)
- DAGNode uses __slots__ + pre-computed np.uint64 bitmask for fast overlap
- build_overlap_edges skips parent-child call edges to avoid double-counting
- parallel_groups uses separate undirected PyGraph for clean component detection
- __call__ refactored into __call__ + _call_inner for clean DAG try/finally
- Capture path uses placeholder node updated after block finalization
- opt parameter NOT in cache key (DAG building is observational only)

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward (architectural):**
- 14-15 pre-existing test failures in test_compile.py -- unrelated to v7.0
- Phase kickback: control qubits are NOT read-only (must track all qubits as dependencies)
- Merge can silently corrupt quantum states -- dedicated verification phase (110) addresses this
