# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-28)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** Phase 18 - Basic Uncomputation Integration

## Current Position

Phase: 18 of 20 (Basic Uncomputation Integration)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase (18-01 complete)
Status: Phase 18 complete
Last activity: 2026-01-28 — Completed 18-01-PLAN.md (core uncomputation infrastructure)

Progress: [████████▓░] 90% (phases 1-18 complete, 19-20 pending)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 58 (v1.0: 41, v1.1: 13, v1.2: 4)
- Average duration: ~6 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~5.8 hours

**By Milestone:**

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| v1.0 MVP | 1-10 | 41 | Complete (2026-01-27) |
| v1.1 QPU State | 11-15 | 13 | Complete (2026-01-28) |
| v1.2 Uncomputation | 16-20 | 4/? | In progress |

**Recent Trend:**
- v1.1: 13 plans in 1 day (accelerated delivery)
- v1.2 Phase 16: 2 plans in 15 min total (infrastructure + tests)
- v1.2 Phase 17: 1 plan in 11 min (C reverse gate generation)
- v1.2 Phase 18: 1 plan in 10 min (core uncomputation infrastructure)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v1.2 work:

- v1.2 Phase 18-01: Layer tracking placement — start_layer captured before operation, end_layer before return
- v1.2 Phase 18-01: LIFO cascade order — dependencies sorted by _creation_order descending for correct reversal
- v1.2 Phase 18-01: Error handling in __del__ — suppress exceptions, print warnings (Python best practice)
- v1.2 Phase 17-01: Empty range handling — start >= end returns silently (no-op, correct behavior)
- v1.2 Phase 17-01: Append vs replace — reversed gates appended to circuit (not replaced)
- v1.2 Phase 17-01: Layer tracking — exposed circuit_s.used_layer to Python for instruction boundaries
- v1.2 Phase 16-02: Test file location decision — replaced tic-tac-toe example in python-backend/test.py with comprehensive test suite
- v1.2 Phase 16-01: Weak references for dependency storage — prevents circular reference memory leaks
- v1.2 Phase 16-01: Creation order cycle prevention — assert parent._creation_order < self._creation_order at add-time
- v1.2 Phase 16-01: Track only quantum operands — classical int operands don't need uncomputation tracking
- v1.2 Phase 16-01: Unidirectional child→parent tracking — defer bidirectional to Phase 20 if needed
- v1.1: Stateless C backend — enables Python-level dependency tracking (v1.2 foundation)
- v1.0: Circuit compilation model — uncomputation appends reverse gates to circuit
- v1.0: Centralized qubit allocator — uncomputation integrates with existing ownership tracking

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From research (SUMMARY.md):**
- Phase 19 may need deeper research during planning — complex interaction between global `_controlled` state (quantum_language.pyx lines 26-29) and scope-aware dependency tracking. Consider `/gsd:research-phase` if planning reveals complexity.

**Known pre-existing issues:**
- Multiplication tests segfault at certain widths (C backend issue, tracked)

**Known limitations (acceptable by design):**
- qint_mod * qint_mod raises NotImplementedError
- apply_merge() placeholder for phase rotation merging

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-28
Stopped at: Completed 18-01-PLAN.md (core uncomputation infrastructure)
Resume file: None (Phase 18 complete, ready for Phase 19 with `/gsd:plan-phase 19`)

## v1.2 Milestone Context

**Goal:** Automatically uncompute intermediate qubits when their lifetime ends

**Phases:**
- Phase 16: Dependency tracking infrastructure (4 requirements) — COMPLETE

- Phase 19: Context manager integration for `with` (2 requirements)
- Phase 20: Modes and user control (6 requirements)

**Research completed:** 2026-01-28 (HIGH confidence, Python weakref + C adjoint pattern validated)

**Phase 16 completed:** 2026-01-28 (2 plans: infrastructure + test suite)
**Phase 17 completed:** 2026-01-28 (1 plan: C reverse gate generation)
**Phase 18 completed:** 2026-01-28 (1 plan: core uncomputation infrastructure)

**Next action:** `/gsd:plan-phase 19` to create detailed plan for context manager integration
