# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** v7.0 Compile Infrastructure -- Phase 107 ready to plan

## Current Position

Phase: 109 of 110 (Selective Sequence Merging)
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: 109-02 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-06 -- Completed 109-02 opt=2 merge pipeline wiring (29 merge tests, 115 related tests)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Call graph DAG lives in Python (compile-time structure, not hot path)
- opt_flag=1 builds DAG alongside normal expansion (no C backend changes)
- rustworkx PyDAG for graph primitives, NumPy bitmasks for qubit overlap
- Sparse circuit arrays deferred to v8.0 (independent C-level track)
- DAGNode uses __slots__ + pre-computed np.uint64 bitmask for fast overlap
- build_overlap_edges skips parent-child call edges to avoid double-counting
- parallel_groups uses separate undirected PyGraph for clean component detection
- __call__ refactored into __call__ + _call_inner for clean DAG try/finally
- Capture path uses placeholder node updated after block finalization
- opt parameter NOT in cache key (DAG building is observational only)
- ASAP scheduling for depth: per-qubit occupancy tracking, each gate occupies max(occupied qubits)+1
- Dual T-count formula: direct T/TDG count preferred, 7*CCX fallback when no T gates
- Critical-path depth in aggregate: sum of per-group max depths from parallel_groups()
- DOT cluster subgraphs only rendered when >1 parallel group
- Fixed-width report columns: Name 20 chars left-aligned, numeric 8 chars right-aligned
- merge_groups reuses parallel_groups pattern with threshold filter and singleton exclusion
- _merge_and_optimize wraps _optimize_gate_list with virtual-to-physical qubit remapping
- parametric+opt=2 guard raises ValueError immediately at construction time
- DAG node _block_ref/_v2r_ref for direct block access during merge (avoids cache_key placeholder issue)
- _apply_merge runs after build_overlap_edges in __call__ finally block when opt==2
- Merged blocks keyed by frozenset of node indices for O(1) group lookup

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward (architectural):**
- 14-15 pre-existing test failures in test_compile.py -- unrelated to v7.0
- Phase kickback: control qubits are NOT read-only (must track all qubits as dependencies)
- Merge can silently corrupt quantum states -- dedicated verification phase (110) addresses this
