## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**Phase 41 decisions:**
- D41-01-1: Keep inline implementations in qint.pyx (Cython 3.0.11 disallows include inside cdef class)
- D41-01-2: Use strict < for LAZY scope comparison (prevents scope-0 auto-uncompute)
- D41-01-3: **REVISED by 41-02** -- Layer tracking IS now set on lt/gt results (no double-reversal risk since widened temps have no layer tracking)
- D41-02-1: Revise D41-01-3: layer tracking set on lt/gt results
- D41-02-2: Keep 4 pre-existing failures as-is (root cause is architectural: layer counter vs instruction counter)

**Phase 42 decisions:**
- D42-01-1: Place copy methods after __invert__ in qint.pyx (grouped with bitwise ops)
- D42-01-2: copy_onto does not set layer tracking or dependencies on target (raw CNOT op)
- D42-01-3: qbool.copy() uses cdef cast to access qubits from qint.copy() result

**Phase 43 decisions:**
- D43-01-1: Mark mixed-width add/sub tests as xfail (pre-existing QFT off-by-one bug, not caused by copy changes)
- D43-02-1: Mark rshift shift>0 tests as xfail (pre-existing BUG-DIV-02: floordiv incorrect results)
- D43-02-2: Add shift=0 short-circuit in lshift/rshift to avoid unnecessary mul/div circuits

### Blockers/Concerns

**Deferred from v1.7 (carry forward to future milestone):**
- BUG-DIV-02: MSB comparison leak in division
- BUG-MOD-REDUCE: _reduce_mod result corruption (needs different circuit structure)
- BUG-COND-MUL-01: Controlled multiplication corruption (not yet investigated)

**Known limitations (not bugs):**
- Dirty ancilla in gt/le comparisons (by design, 2 xfail preserved)
- 4 pre-existing uncomputation test failures (lt/ge ancilla, compound and/or OOM) -- root cause: circuit optimizer parallelizes gates into shared layers, making used_layer unreliable for gate boundary tracking
- Future improvement: replace layer-based tracking with instruction-counter-based tracking
- BUG-WIDTH-ADD: Mixed-width QFT addition/subtraction off-by-one (discovered in Phase 43, pre-existing)
