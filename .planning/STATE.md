# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-28)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** Phase 16 - Dependency Tracking Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 16 of 20 (Dependency Tracking Infrastructure)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase (16-01 complete)
Status: Phase 16 complete
Last activity: 2026-01-28 — Completed 16-01-PLAN.md (dependency tracking infrastructure)

Progress: [████████░░] 76% (phases 1-16 complete, 17-20 pending)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 55 (v1.0: 41, v1.1: 13, v1.2: 1)
- Average duration: ~5 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~4.7 hours

**By Milestone:**

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| v1.0 MVP | 1-10 | 41 | Complete (2026-01-27) |
| v1.1 QPU State | 11-15 | 13 | Complete (2026-01-28) |
| v1.2 Uncomputation | 16-20 | 1/? | In progress |

**Recent Trend:**
- v1.1: 13 plans in 1 day (accelerated delivery)
- v1.2 Phase 16: 1 plan in 11 min (dependency tracking infrastructure)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v1.2 work:

- v1.2 Phase 16: Weak references for dependency storage — prevents circular reference memory leaks
- v1.2 Phase 16: Creation order cycle prevention — assert parent._creation_order < self._creation_order at add-time
- v1.2 Phase 16: Track only quantum operands — classical int operands don't need uncomputation tracking
- v1.2 Phase 16: Unidirectional child→parent tracking — defer bidirectional to Phase 20 if needed
- v1.1: Stateless C backend — enables Python-level dependency tracking (v1.2 foundation)
- v1.0: Circuit compilation model — uncomputation appends reverse gates to circuit
- v1.0: Centralized qubit allocator — uncomputation integrates with existing ownership tracking

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From research (SUMMARY.md):**
- Phase 19 may need deeper research during planning — complex interaction between global `_controlled` state (quantum_language.pyx lines 26-29) and scope-aware dependency tracking. Consider `/gsd:research-phase` if planning reveals complexity.

**Known pre-existing issues:**
- Multiplication tests segfault at certain widths (C backend issue, tracked)

**Known limitations (acceptable by design):**
- qint_mod * qint_mod raises NotImplementedError
- apply_merge() placeholder for phase rotation merging

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-28
Stopped at: Completed 16-01-PLAN.md (dependency tracking infrastructure)
Resume file: None (Phase 16 complete, ready for Phase 17 with `/gsd:plan-phase 17`)

## v1.2 Milestone Context

**Goal:** Automatically uncompute intermediate qubits when their lifetime ends

**Phases:**
- Phase 16: Dependency tracking infrastructure (4 requirements)
- Phase 17: C reverse gate generation (2 requirements)
- Phase 18: Basic uncomputation integration (3 requirements)
- Phase 19: Context manager integration for `with` (2 requirements)
- Phase 20: Modes and user control (6 requirements)

**Research completed:** 2026-01-28 (HIGH confidence, Python weakref + C adjoint pattern validated)

**Next action:** `/gsd:plan-phase 16` to create detailed plan for dependency tracking
