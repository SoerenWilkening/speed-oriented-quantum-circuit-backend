## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Milestone decisions archived. See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**Recent (Phase 28-29):**

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 28-01 | Separate tests/conftest.py for verification tests vs tests/python/conftest.py for unit tests | Keep fixture namespaces distinct, avoid conflicts between test categories |
| 28-01 | verify_circuit returns (actual, expected) tuple instead of asserting directly | Gives tests flexibility in assertion style and failure message formatting |
| 28-01 | Exhaustive testing threshold at 4 bits, sampled testing for 5+ bits | Balance coverage (all 256 pairs at 4-bit) vs runtime (sampled edge cases + random at higher widths) |
| 28-01 | Deterministic sampling with random.seed(42) | Reproducible test cases across runs for debugging |
| 28-02 | Generate parametrize data at module level via helper functions | Clean test structure, avoids pytest collection overhead from dynamic generation |
| 28-02 | Use default argument binding in circuit_builder closures | Avoids Python closure variable capture issues in loops |
| 28-02 | Document C backend circuit() reset bug rather than attempting fix | C backend memory management fix is risky and time-consuming, beyond v1.5 scope |
| 29-01 | Defer BUG-01 and BUG-02 fixes, create test files only | Investigation revealed root cause is C backend QFT arithmetic (BUG-04), not Python operator logic |
| 29-01 | tests/bugfix/ directory for bug reproduction tests | Separate targeted bug tests from exhaustive verification tests |
| 29-02 | Use MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE for multiplication num_layer allocation | Conservative but safe - formula-based calculation was insufficient |
| 29-02 | Increase per-layer gate allocation to 10*bits | Progressive testing showed 2*bits, 3*bits, 4*bits all still segfaulted |
| 29-02 | Accept partial fixes for both BUG-03 and BUG-04 | Segfault fixed (primary goal), logic bugs documented for future work |
| 29-03 | Fix bit-ordering with bin[bits-1-bit_idx] reversal | two_complement() returns MSB-first, QFT formula needs LSB-first iteration |
| 29-03 | Fix cache update to use rotations[i] not rotations[bits-i-1] | Must match initial build path indexing for gate value consistency |
| 29-03 | Verify formula against Qiskit reference | Analytical verification when BUG-05 prevents reliable test execution |
| 29-05 | Accept partial fix for BUG-03 multiplication | Investigation identified root cause but fix incomplete - document for future work |
| 29-05 | Disable GCC LTO due to compiler bug | GCC 15 -flto triggers internal error, disabled until toolchain fixed |
| 29-04 | BUG-04 fix scope limited to CQ_add only | QQ_add (qint+qint) uses different implementation, needs separate fix |
| 29-04 | BUG-01 and BUG-02 remain blocked by incomplete BUG-04 | Cannot test/fix until QQ_add bit-ordering corrected |
| 29-06 | Fixed QQ_add control qubit mapping: 2*bits-1-bit instead of bits+bit | Control bits were swapped - outer loop MSB-first but needs LSB-first qubit access |
| 29-06 | CQ_add analytically correct, test failures are BUG-05 interference | Plan 29-03 fix is mathematically sound, BUG-05 cache pollution causes wrong results |
| 29-06 | Accept partial verification due to BUG-05 blocking test suite | Simple tests pass (0+0, 1+0, 1+1), complex tests hit memory explosion from BUG-05 |
| 29-08 | QQ_add basic addition verified working (3+5=8) | Plan 29-06 control fix works for simple addition cases |
| 29-08 | Subtraction and comparison failures transitive from QQ_add errors | Comparison logic is correct, failures trace to subtraction which depends on QQ_add |
| 29-08 | BUG-05 prevents definitive QQ_add diagnosis | Cannot distinguish QQ_add bit-ordering bugs from BUG-05 cache pollution |
| 29-10 | Two-part CQ_add fix: qubit_array reversal + rotation reversal | QFT-no-swaps convention mismatch requires compensating at both Python and C layers |
| 29-10 | Path taken: convention fix (not BUG-05 cache) | Isolation test confirmed 0+1 fails in fresh process, ruling out cache pollution |
| 29-09 | Fix QFT processing order at the source (gate.c) rather than patching adders | Fixing the root cause (QFT convention) eliminates all downstream workarounds |
| 29-09 | Revert 29-10 CQ_add workarounds after QFT fix | With correct QFT, qubit_array reversal and rotation reversal double-compensate |
| 29-09 | Accept comparison failures as BUG-05 pre-existing | Verified identical failures with original code; BUG-05 cache contamination is root cause |

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known C backend bugs (v1.5 targets):**
- **BUG-05 (CRITICAL BLOCKER - ESCALATED):** circuit() does not properly reset state - causes memory explosion, blocks ALL verification of arithmetic fixes. Comparison tests (BUG-02) fail specifically because QQ_add cache is reused incorrectly when called twice in same circuit.
- **BUG-04 (FULLY FIXED):** QFT convention fix (29-09) resolves the root cause. CQ_add: all 7 tests pass. QQ_add: all 5 subtraction tests pass.
- **BUG-03 (INVESTIGATED):** Multiplication returns 0 - root cause identified but algorithm needs deeper redesign
- **BUG-01 (RESOLVED):** All 5 subtraction tests pass (3-7=12, 7-3=4, 5-5=0, 0-1=15, 15-0=15). Fixed by QFT convention correction in 29-09.
- **BUG-02 (BLOCKED BY BUG-05):** Comparison tests fail due to BUG-05 circuit cache contamination when QQ_add is called twice (subtract + restore). The comparison logic itself is correct. Requires BUG-05 fix for resolution.

**Known pre-existing issues (not v1.5 scope):**
- Nested quantum conditionals require quantum-quantum AND
- Build system: pip install -e . fails with absolute path error
- Some tests/python/ tests cause segfaults during execution (discovered in 28-02, pre-existing)
