# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** v1.5 Bug Fixes & Exhaustive Verification -- Phase 29: C Backend Bug Fixes (gaps found round 3)

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Milestone decisions archived. See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**Recent (Phase 29 round 3):**

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 29-13 | Revert commit 6328d19 (BUG-02/BUG-03 fix attempt) | Both fixes caused regressions; target qubit reversal broke trivial multiplication, __le__ rewrite ineffective |
| 29-14 | Skip plan 14 entirely | Plan 13 regressions invalidated plan 14's premise (investigate after rebuild) |
| 29-15 | Use type(self) is circuit guard for reset logic | qint extends circuit; super().__init__() must not destroy active circuit mid-construction |
| 29-16 | Use (n+1)-bit widened temporaries in __gt__ | n-bit modular subtraction wraps for differences >= 2^(n-1), corrupting sign bit |
| 29-16 | Remove layer tracking from comparison results | GC triggers gate reversal via __del__ -> _do_uncompute |
| 29-16 | Simplify __le__ to ~(self > other) delegation | Eliminates fragile OR logic; correctness follows from __gt__ |
| 29-17 | Rewrite QQ_mul with explicit CCP decomposition | Helper functions had two independent bugs (inverted targets + inverted b-qubit mapping); clean rewrite safer |
| 29-17 | Use b_ctrl = 2*bits+j for b qubit at weight 2^j | Right-aligned storage: LSB at lowest index in each register |

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known C backend bugs (v1.5 targets):**
- **BUG-05 (FULLY FIXED):** circuit() now properly frees old circuit and resets all Python globals. Fixed in plan 29-15.
- **BUG-04 (FULLY FIXED):** All 7 QFT addition tests pass deterministically.
- **BUG-03 (FULLY FIXED):** QQ_mul rewrote with correct CCP decomposition and qubit mapping. 5/5 multiplication tests pass. Fixed in plan 29-17.
- **BUG-01 (FULLY FIXED):** All 5 subtraction tests pass.
- **BUG-02 (FULLY FIXED):** All 6 comparison tests pass. Three root causes fixed: MSB index, GC gate reversal, unsigned overflow. Fixed in plan 29-16.
