# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** v1.5 Bug Fixes & Exhaustive Verification -- Phase 29: C Backend Bug Fixes (gaps found round 3)

## Current Position

Phase: 29 of 33 (C Backend Bug Fixes)
Plan: 15 of 18 (gap closure round)
Status: In progress -- BUG-05 fixed, BUG-02 and BUG-03 remain
Last activity: 2026-01-31 -- Completed 29-15-PLAN.md (circuit reset fix)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Milestone decisions archived. See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**Recent (Phase 29 round 3):**

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 29-13 | Revert commit 6328d19 (BUG-02/BUG-03 fix attempt) | Both fixes caused regressions; target qubit reversal broke trivial multiplication, __le__ rewrite ineffective |
| 29-14 | Skip plan 14 entirely | Plan 13 regressions invalidated plan 14's premise (investigate after rebuild) |
| 29-15 | Use type(self) is circuit guard for reset logic | qint extends circuit; super().__init__() must not destroy active circuit mid-construction |

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known C backend bugs (v1.5 targets):**
- **BUG-05 (FULLY FIXED):** circuit() now properly frees old circuit and resets all Python globals. 12/12 tests pass in combined pytest run. Fixed in plan 29-15.
- **BUG-04 (FULLY FIXED):** All 7 QFT addition tests pass deterministically.
- **BUG-03 (PARTIALLY FIXED):** CQ_mul 100% correct. QQ_mul: trivial cases pass (0*x, 1*1), non-trivial wrong. Algorithm needs deeper redesign.
- **BUG-01 (FULLY FIXED):** All 5 subtraction tests pass. Combined pytest run now works (BUG-05 fixed).
- **BUG-02 (UNFIXED):** Comparison always returns 0 for true cases. __le__ rewrite to ~(self > other) did NOT help. Root cause is in comparison result extraction, not QQ_add invocation pattern.
