## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| ID | What | Why | Impact | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-11-01-01 | Removed purely classical functions that don't generate quantum gates | Functions only wrote to QPU_state without gate generation | Reduced dead code and global state dependencies | 11 |
| DEC-11-01-02 | Documented removal rationale in comments | Future developers need to know why functions were removed | Phase-tagged removal comments provide traceability | 11 |
| DEC-11-02-01 | Keep legacy P_add/cP_add as deprecated wrappers | Maintain backward compatibility during migration | Future plans migrate callers incrementally | 11 |
| DEC-11-02-02 | Fix memory allocation bugs in phase gate functions | Original functions had missing calloc calls | All new parameterized functions have correct memory management | 11 |
| DEC-11-03-01 | Parameterize legacy semi-classical functions without backward compatibility wrappers | Modern alternatives exist (Q_and, Q_xor, Q_or), no need for deprecated wrappers | Callers will migrate to explicit parameters or modern functions | 11 |
| DEC-11-03-02 | Selectively parameterize only functions reading QPU_state | qq_and_seq and qq_or_seq have commented-out reads, don't need changes | Avoids unnecessary refactoring of functions already independent of global state | 11 |
| DEC-11-04-01 | Removed deprecated QPU_state wrapper functions | Functions still referenced QPU_state which was being removed, blocking compilation | Callers must use parameterized versions (_param or _width suffix) | 11 |
| DEC-11-04-02 | Added M_PI definition for portability | M_PI availability varies across platforms and compilers | Portable compilation on all platforms without math constant issues | 11 |
| DEC-12-01-01 | Simplified multi-bit comparison to 1-2 bits fully working, 3+ placeholder | MAXCONTROLS=2 limitation requires ancilla or large_control array for 3+ bit AND | Multi-bit comparisons (3+) partially implemented, full version deferred to Phase 12-02 | 12 |
| DEC-12-01-02 | Use empty sequence (num_layer=0) for overflow instead of NULL | Distinguishes overflow (valid call, value too large) from invalid parameters | Callers can check seq->num_layer == 0 to detect overflow condition | 12 |
| DEC-12-01-03 | Created C test infrastructure in tests/c/ directory | Direct C-level testing without Python bindings for unit testing | Future C functions can be tested in isolation with make && ./test_* | 12 |
| DEC-12-02-01 | Use large_control array for >2 controls instead of ancilla decomposition | gate_t structure already supports large_control, avoids ancilla qubit overhead | Simple, efficient n-controlled gates without additional qubit allocation | 12 |
| DEC-12-02-02 | mcx() allocates large_control, caller's free_sequence() deallocates | Consistent with existing memory management pattern in codebase | Test helper and future code must free large_control when freeing sequences | 12 |

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Resolved in v1.0:**
- Most global state eliminated from C backend
- Memory bugs fixed (sizeof, NULL checks, initialization)
- QQ_mul segfault fixed via MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE allocation

**Resolved in v1.1:**
- QPU_state completely removed (Phase 11) — Full system is now stateless
- Python bindings updated to remove QPU_state dependency (Phase 11-05)
- Comparison functions parameterization (Phase 12) — Complete for all bit widths (1-64)
- Multi-bit (3+) comparison full n-bit AND logic (Phase 12-02) — Complete using mcx()

**Active in v1.1:**
None

**Known pre-existing issues:**
- Multiplication tests segfault at certain widths (C backend issue, unrelated to Phase 11)

**Known limitations (acceptable):**
- qint_mod * qint_mod raises NotImplementedError (by design)
- apply_merge() placeholder for phase rotation merging

### Quick Tasks Completed

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-27
Stopped at: Completed 12-02-PLAN.md (Multi-Bit Comparison Gap Closure)
Resume file: .planning/phases/12-comparison-function-refactoring/12-02-SUMMARY.md
Note: Phase 12 complete! All comparison functions now work for ALL bit widths (1-64). Requirements GLOB-02 and GLOB-03 fully satisfied.
