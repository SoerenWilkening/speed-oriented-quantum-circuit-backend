## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Bottom-up restructuring (C first): Foundation must be solid before adding features
- Open source release target: Requires clean code, docs, tests
- Keep circuit compilation model: Direct execution is future work
- Use Ruff instead of Black + isort + Flake8: Single tool, 10-100x faster (01-01)
- Use LLVM style for clang-format: Standard, readable, 100-column limit (01-01)
- Pre-commit hooks auto-fix formatting: Reduce manual work, ensure consistency (01-01)
- Characterization tests capture current behavior as-is: Purpose is regression detection, not correctness validation (01-02)
- Tests organized by functional area: qint operations, qbool operations, circuit generation (01-02)
- Auto-detect compiler in Makefile: Search for gcc/clang/cc rather than hardcoding (01-03)
- Use calloc for sequence_t array allocations: Ensures zero-initialization and prevents undefined behavior (02-01)
- Standard sequence_t initialization pattern: Allocate gates_per_layer and seq arrays immediately after malloc(sizeof(sequence_t)) (02-01)
- Cleanup-on-error pattern for complex allocations: Free in reverse order on any allocation failure (02-02)
- Temp pointer pattern for realloc: Preserves original pointer on failure (02-02)
- Return NULL from all allocation functions: Enables error propagation to callers (02-02)
- Explicit context passing via circuit_t* parameter: No global circuit variable (02-03)
- OWNERSHIP comments document memory responsibilities: Added at every allocation point (02-03)
- Keep instruction_list and QPU_state as globals for now: Stateless sequence generation, will address in Phase 4 (02-03)
- Hard-coded ALLOCATOR_MAX_QUBITS limit (8192): Prevents runaway allocation bugs (03-01)
- Freed stack only reuses single-qubit allocations initially: Simplified implementation, multi-qubit reuse can be added later (03-01)
- DEBUG_OWNERSHIP conditional compilation: Zero runtime overhead in production, enables ownership tracking for debugging (03-01)
- circuit_get_allocator() accessor for Python bindings: Follows C API pattern for opaque structs (03-01)
- QINT/QBOOL use allocator_alloc() with is_ancilla=true flag: Enables ancilla tracking, matches semantic meaning (03-02)
- free_element determines width from MSB: Enables correct allocator_free(start, width) for both QINT and QBOOL (03-02)
- Backward compat tracking maintained with documented quirk: Original decrement-by-1 behavior preserved during migration (03-02)
- Cast circuit_t* to circuit_s* in Cython calls: Matches C function signatures with forward-declared structs (03-03)

- Cython cdef declarations at function start: Language requirement, before any Python statements (03-03)
- types.h as foundation module: Single source of truth for shared types (qubit_t, gate_t, sequence_t) with zero dependencies (04-01)
- definition.h as backward compatibility wrapper: Enables gradual migration from old code (04-01)

- README qint_mod examples use qint_mod * int: All examples use working patterns (10-05)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**RESOLVED:**
- QQ_mul C-layer segfault - FIXED in 07-06 by using MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE for layer allocation
- qint_mod multiplication type check - FIXED in 07-06 by using isinstance()

**Research Flags:**
- Phase 6: Medium priority - quantum bit shift/rotate circuits
- Phase 8: Advanced quantum operations (Grover, Shor components)

**Current Concerns:**
- Virtual environment symlinks point to macOS paths, need proper venv setup for local development (01-01, 01-02)
- Existing codebase has 65+ Ruff violations (bare except, tabs vs spaces) that need cleanup (01-01)
- IntegerComparison.c uses conservative +10 buffer for layer allocation - may need precise calculation in future (02-01)
- Circuit complexity scales quadratically with width for multiplication: MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE (10000) used (07-06)
- Running 250+ tests in sequence may cause resource exhaustion abort - individual test files pass
- QQ_mul segfault discovered during 10-02: quantum-quantum multiplication crashes for width >= 2 (10-02)
  - Affects test_qint_mul_qint and test_phase7_arithmetic multiplication tests
  - Pre-existing C-layer issue in Backend/src/IntegerMultiplication.c
  - Needs separate debugging phase, test skipped for now with tracking comment
