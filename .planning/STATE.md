## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 10 (Module Separation)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-26 - Completed 04-02-PLAN.md (Extract optimizer module)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 36%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Average duration: 5.5 min
- Total execution time: 1.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 - Testing Foundation | 3 | 18 min | 6 min |
| 02 - C Layer Cleanup | 3 | 18 min | 6 min |
| 03 - Memory Architecture | 3 | 22 min | 7.3 min |
| 04 - Module Separation | 2 | 8 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 03-02 (2 min), 03-03 (15 min), 04-01 (3 min), 04-02 (5 min)
- Trend: Phase 4 maintaining efficient pace, 04-02 at 5 min (module extraction with deviations)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Bottom-up restructuring (C first): Foundation must be solid before adding features
- Open source release target: Requires clean code, docs, tests
- Keep circuit compilation model: Direct execution is future work
- Use Ruff instead of Black + isort + Flake8: Single tool, 10-100x faster (01-01)
- Use LLVM style for clang-format: Standard, readable, 100-column limit (01-01)
- Pre-commit hooks auto-fix formatting: Reduce manual work, ensure consistency (01-01)
- Characterization tests capture current behavior as-is: Purpose is regression detection, not correctness validation (01-02)
- Tests organized by functional area: qint operations, qbool operations, circuit generation (01-02)
- Auto-detect compiler in Makefile: Search for gcc/clang/cc rather than hardcoding (01-03)
- Use calloc for sequence_t array allocations: Ensures zero-initialization and prevents undefined behavior (02-01)
- Standard sequence_t initialization pattern: Allocate gates_per_layer and seq arrays immediately after malloc(sizeof(sequence_t)) (02-01)
- Cleanup-on-error pattern for complex allocations: Free in reverse order on any allocation failure (02-02)
- Temp pointer pattern for realloc: Preserves original pointer on failure (02-02)
- Return NULL from all allocation functions: Enables error propagation to callers (02-02)
- Explicit context passing via circuit_t* parameter: No global circuit variable (02-03)
- OWNERSHIP comments document memory responsibilities: Added at every allocation point (02-03)
- Keep instruction_list and QPU_state as globals for now: Stateless sequence generation, will address in Phase 4 (02-03)
- Hard-coded ALLOCATOR_MAX_QUBITS limit (8192): Prevents runaway allocation bugs (03-01)
- Freed stack only reuses single-qubit allocations initially: Simplified implementation, multi-qubit reuse can be added later (03-01)
- DEBUG_OWNERSHIP conditional compilation: Zero runtime overhead in production, enables ownership tracking for debugging (03-01)
- circuit_get_allocator() accessor for Python bindings: Follows C API pattern for opaque structs (03-01)
- QINT/QBOOL use allocator_alloc() with is_ancilla=true flag: Enables ancilla tracking, matches semantic meaning (03-02)
- free_element determines width from MSB: Enables correct allocator_free(start, width) for both QINT and QBOOL (03-02)
- Backward compat tracking maintained with documented quirk: Original decrement-by-1 behavior preserved during migration (03-02)
- Cast circuit_t* to circuit_s* in Cython calls: Matches C function signatures with forward-declared structs (03-03)
- Add qubit_allocator.c to setup.py sources: Required for linking circuit_get_allocator symbol (03-03)
- Cython cdef declarations at function start: Language requirement, before any Python statements (03-03)
- types.h as foundation module: Single source of truth for shared types (qubit_t, gate_t, sequence_t) with zero dependencies (04-01)
- definition.h as backward compatibility wrapper: Enables gradual migration from old code (04-01)
- Dependency comments in headers: Makes include hierarchy explicit and maintainable (04-01)
- optimizer.c module extraction: Gate optimization logic separated from QPU.c, reducing god object from 201 to 18 lines (04-02)
- Instruction state scope clarified: Globals kept only for sequence generation (CQ_add, CC_mul), not gate optimization (04-02)
- circuit_t typedef uses named struct: struct circuit_s pattern for forward declaration compatibility (04-02)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
- Phase 3 enables both Phase 4 (Module Separation) and Phase 5 (Variable-Width Integers)
- Phase 5 and Phase 6 can run in parallel

**Research Flags:**
- Phase 5: Medium priority - optimal gate sequences for variable-width arithmetic
- Phase 6: Medium priority - quantum bit shift/rotate circuits
- Phase 7: High priority - QFT-based arithmetic and modular operations

**Current Concerns:**
- Virtual environment symlinks point to macOS paths, need proper venv setup for local development (01-01, 01-02)
- Existing codebase has 65+ Ruff violations (bare except, tabs vs spaces) that need cleanup (01-01)
- Fixed critical C compilation issues in Integer.c and QPU.c (missing stdint.h) (01-02)
- IntegerComparison.c uses conservative +10 buffer for layer allocation - may need precise calculation in future (02-01)
- Phase 3 complete - Qubit allocator fully integrated with both C (QINT/QBOOL) and Python (qint/qbool) layers
- Backward compat tracking still active in both C and Python for gradual migration
- circuit_stats() enables debugging and validation of allocation behavior
- Ready for Phase 4 (Module Separation) and Phase 5 (Variable-Width Integers)
