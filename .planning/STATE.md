# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** Phase 94 — Parametric Compilation (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 94 of 94 (Parametric Compilation) — fifth phase of v5.0
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase 94 complete (all plans executed)
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — Phase 94 complete (parametric compilation)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (3/3 Phase 94 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 258 (v1.0-v4.1)
- Average duration: ~13 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~43.3 hours

**By Milestone:**

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| v1.0-v2.3 | 1-64 | 166 | Complete |
| v3.0 Fault-Tolerant | 65-75 | 35 | Complete (2026-02-18) |
| v4.0 Grover's Algorithm | 76-81 | 18 | Complete (2026-02-22) |
| v4.1 Quality & Efficiency | 82-89 | 21 | Complete (2026-02-24) |
| v5.0 Advanced Arithmetic | 90-94 | ? | In progress |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward (architectural):**
- BUG-DIV-02/BUG-QFT-DIV — FIXED in Phase 91 (C-level restoring divmod)
- BUG-MOD-REDUCE — PARTIALLY FIXED in Phase 91 (leak reduced from n+1 to 1 qubit per mod_reduce call; QQ division and mod_reduce still have persistent ancilla when reduction triggers)
- Parametric Toffoli CQ limitation — value-dependent gate topology requires per-value fallback (RESOLVED in Phase 94 — auto-detected and documented)
- Research flags: Phase 92 (HIGH risk — Beauregard ancilla layout) — Phase 94 MEDIUM-HIGH risk resolved via two-capture probe

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-25
Stopped at: Phase 94 complete, all 3 plans executed
Resume action: `/gsd:progress` — v5.0 milestone may be complete
