## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.
- [Phase 117]: Replaced _controlled/_control_bool/_list_of_controls flat globals with single _control_stack list
- [Phase 117]: Updated __enter__/__exit__ and compile.py to use stack push/pop instead of set_controlled/set_control_bool
- [Phase 117]: Removed unused backward-compat imports from oracle.py after switching to stack-based save/restore
- [Phase 118]: AND-ancilla uncomputed after scope qbool cleanup but before scope depth decrement and control pop
- [Phase 118]: Tests rewritten to use qbool(True/False) instead of comparisons (5-6 qubits vs 38)
- [Phase 118]: Used separate TestThreeLevelNesting class for 3+ level tests to organize by nesting depth
- [Phase 118]: Used 2-bit result registers for 3+ level tests (max value 3, keeps qubit count at 7-9)
- [Phase 119]: Tests-only phase: compile replay correctly controls via AND-ancilla in nested with-blocks, no code changes needed
- [Phase 119]: Pre-existing inverse and compiled-calling-compiled issues documented with skipped tests, not Phase 119 scope
- [Phase 120]: ql.qarray() is canonical constructor (matches ql.qint/ql.qbool pattern); ql.array() kept as undocumented alias
- [Phase 120]: Row assignment in __setitem__: copies elements from value qarray to flat index range, broadcasts scalar to all row positions

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward (architectural):**
- 14-15 pre-existing test failures in test_compile.py
- QQ division persistent ancilla leak (fundamental algorithmic limitation)

**v9.0 risks (from research):**
- AND-ancilla lifecycle ordering is subtle (uncompute after scope qbools, before restoring outer control)
- Chess engine OOM risk from uncompiled loop expansion (mitigate with compiled sub-predicates + gc.collect)
