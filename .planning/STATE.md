## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Chess walk must evaluate move legality in superposition (not classical pre-filtering)
- Knights + Kings move types for v8.0 (non-sliding pieces only)
- All predicates must use standard ql constructs -- no raw gate emission for application logic
- Diffusion must use arithmetic counting circuit (not O(2^d_max) enumeration)
- Compile infrastructure qubit_set operations to use numpy
- DAGNode dual-storage: frozenset qubit_set for API compat, numpy _qubit_array for fast overlap
- Bitmask stays Python int (>64 qubit arbitrary precision), only overlap uses numpy
- Numpy qubit_set construction shows negligible perf difference at current sizes, justified by architectural consistency
- _build_qubit_set_numpy centralizes all qubit set construction in compile.py
- No edge-of-board filtering in move table -- quantum predicate handles legality
- 8 entries per piece in move table (knights and kings both have 8 offsets)
- [Phase 113]: No edge-of-board filtering in move table -- quantum predicate handles legality
- [Phase 113]: counting_diffusion_core extracted as shared module-level function in walk.py
- [Phase 113]: counting_diffusion_core extracted as shared module-level function in walk.py for chess_walk.py integration
- [Phase 114]: Used .adjoint() instead of .inverse() for ancilla-free predicate reversal
- [Phase 114]: Nested with qbool raises NotImplementedError; use & operator for Toffoli AND instead
- [Phase 114]: Per-source friendly_flag ancilla avoids & operator ancilla-reuse interference in loops
- [Phase 115]: Per-position attack_flag accumulation instead of per-attacker enemy_flag to avoid & operator ancilla overflow on large attack tables
- [Phase 115]: Nested @ql.compile calls work for sub-predicate composition -- no need to inline sub-predicate logic
- [Phase 115]: Combined 2x2 predicate uses 34 qubits -- circuit-build-only testing + separate AND composition verification
- [Phase 116]: One combined predicate per move table entry, not per level (piece_type varies within white levels)
- [Phase 116]: Offset-based oracle enumerates all 64 source squares per branch value with classical off-board filtering
- [Phase 116]: walk_step uses inline @ql_compile with explicit args, no closure/mutable-dict pattern
- [Phase 116]: MAX_DEPTH=2 for depth-2 walk (white move + black response)

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward (architectural):**
- 14-15 pre-existing test failures in test_compile.py -- unrelated to v8.0
- Diffusion combinatorial explosion is a hard blocker for large branching (Phase 113 addresses)
- MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE (300K) may be exceeded by chess circuits -- assess in Phase 113
- Nested `with qbool:` limitation requires flat Toffoli-AND predicate design
