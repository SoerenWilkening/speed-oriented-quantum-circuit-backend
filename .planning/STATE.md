## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v1.2 work:

- v1.2 Phase 20-02: keep() is permanent — flag never cleared automatically, simplest implementation
- v1.2 Phase 20-02: keep() only affects __del__ — explicit uncompute() always works, gives user full control
- v1.2 Phase 20-02: keep() returns None — follows Python convention for methods with side effects only
- v1.2 Phase 20-01: Mode captured at creation time — prevents retroactive mode changes, each qbool has immutable behavior
- v1.2 Phase 20-01: Eager mode immediate uncomputation — minimizes peak qubit count by freeing on GC regardless of scope
- v1.2 Phase 20-01: Lazy mode scope-based uncomputation — minimizes gates by keeping intermediates alive within scope
- v1.2 Phase 20-01: _uncompute_mode made public — enables testing and debugging access to mode flag
- v1.2 Phase 19-01: Uncompute before restore — uncomputation happens BEFORE restoring control state for quantum correctness
- v1.2 Phase 19-01: LIFO order via _creation_order — sort scope_qbools by _creation_order descending
- v1.2 Phase 19-01: Skip already-uncomputed in __exit__ — allows early explicit uncompute (though refcount prevents it)
- v1.2 Phase 19-01: Condition survives own block — not registered in scope it controls (lower creation_scope)
- v1.2 Phase 19-01: Registration constraints — only register when scope_stack non-empty, scope > 0, creation_scope matches
- v1.2 Phase 18-02: Refcount threshold of 2 (self + getrefcount) for explicit uncompute validation
- v1.2 Phase 18-02: Guards added to all 11 quantum operations for defense in depth
- v1.2 Phase 18-01: Layer tracking placement — start_layer captured before operation, end_layer before return
- v1.2 Phase 18-01: LIFO cascade order — dependencies sorted by _creation_order descending for correct reversal
- v1.2 Phase 18-01: Error handling in __del__ — suppress exceptions, print warnings (Python best practice)
- v1.2 Phase 17-01: Empty range handling — start >= end returns silently (no-op, correct behavior)
- v1.2 Phase 17-01: Append vs replace — reversed gates appended to circuit (not replaced)
- v1.2 Phase 17-01: Layer tracking — exposed circuit_s.used_layer to Python for instruction boundaries
- v1.2 Phase 16-02: Test file location decision — replaced tic-tac-toe example in python-backend/test.py with comprehensive test suite
- v1.2 Phase 16-01: Weak references for dependency storage — prevents circular reference memory leaks
- v1.2 Phase 16-01: Creation order cycle prevention — assert parent._creation_order < self._creation_order at add-time
- v1.2 Phase 16-01: Track only quantum operands — classical int operands don't need uncomputation tracking
- v1.2 Phase 16-01: Unidirectional child→parent tracking — defer bidirectional to Phase 20 if needed
- v1.1: Stateless C backend — enables Python-level dependency tracking (v1.2 foundation)
- v1.0: Circuit compilation model — uncomputation appends reverse gates to circuit
- v1.0: Centralized qubit allocator — uncomputation integrates with existing ownership tracking

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Phase 19 execution:**
- Nested `with` statements require quantum-quantum AND operation (NotImplementedError at line 809)
- This affects future quantum control flow but doesn't block Phase 20
- Single-level contexts work correctly, nested AND can be added separately

**Known pre-existing issues:**
- Multiplication tests segfault at certain widths (C backend issue, tracked)
- Nested quantum conditionals require quantum-quantum AND implementation

**Known limitations (acceptable by design):**
- qint_mod * qint_mod raises NotImplementedError
- apply_merge() placeholder for phase rotation merging
- Explicit uncompute inside `with` block fails refcount check (scope_stack reference) — use scope-based cleanup instead
