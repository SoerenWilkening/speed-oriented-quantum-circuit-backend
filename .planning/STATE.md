# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-28)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.2 — Automatic Uncomputation

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-01-28 — Milestone v1.2 started

Progress: Defining requirements for automatic uncomputation

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Summary:**
- Total plans completed: 41
- Average duration: 5.1 min
- Total execution time: 3.14 hours
- Phases: 10
- Requirements shipped: 37/37

**v1.1 Progress:**
- Total plans completed: 15
- Average duration: 4.7 min
- Phases complete: 5/5 (Phase 11, Phase 12, Phase 13, Phase 14, Phase 15 complete)
- Requirements shipped: 10/10 (GLOB-01 through INIT-01 complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

v1.1 decisions archived to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

See also: PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for project-wide decisions.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Resolved in v1.0:**
- Most global state eliminated from C backend
- Memory bugs fixed (sizeof, NULL checks, initialization)
- QQ_mul segfault fixed via MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE allocation

**Resolved in v1.1:**
- QPU_state completely removed — Full system is now stateless
- Comparison functions parameterization complete for all bit widths (1-64)
- n-controlled gate support in execution layer, optimizer, gate.c

**Known pre-existing issues:**
- Multiplication tests segfault at certain widths (C backend issue)

**Known limitations (acceptable):**
- qint_mod * qint_mod raises NotImplementedError (by design)
- apply_merge() placeholder for phase rotation merging

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-28
Stopped at: v1.1 milestone completed
Resume file: .planning/MILESTONES.md
Note: v1.1 shipped! Stateless C backend, efficient comparisons, classical initialization. 149 tests at 100% pass rate. Ready for v1.2 planning.

## v1.1 Milestone Summary

**SHIPPED 2026-01-28**

See `.planning/MILESTONES.md` for full milestone record.
See `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md` for archived roadmap.
See `.planning/milestones/v1.1-REQUIREMENTS.md` for archived requirements.

**Key Achievements:**
- QPU_state global completely removed — stateless architecture
- Multi-controlled gates (mcx) for n-bit comparisons (1-64 bits)
- Memory-efficient comparison operators (in-place pattern)
- Classical qint initialization with auto-width mode

**Next Steps:**
- `/gsd:new-milestone` to define v1.2 requirements and roadmap
