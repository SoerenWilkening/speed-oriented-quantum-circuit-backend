## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Milestone decisions archived. See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**Recent (Phase 28-29):**

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 28-01 | Separate tests/conftest.py for verification tests vs tests/python/conftest.py for unit tests | Keep fixture namespaces distinct, avoid conflicts between test categories |
| 28-01 | verify_circuit returns (actual, expected) tuple instead of asserting directly | Gives tests flexibility in assertion style and failure message formatting |
| 28-01 | Exhaustive testing threshold at 4 bits, sampled testing for 5+ bits | Balance coverage (all 256 pairs at 4-bit) vs runtime (sampled edge cases + random at higher widths) |
| 28-01 | Deterministic sampling with random.seed(42) | Reproducible test cases across runs for debugging |
| 28-02 | Generate parametrize data at module level via helper functions | Clean test structure, avoids pytest collection overhead from dynamic generation |
| 28-02 | Use default argument binding in circuit_builder closures | Avoids Python closure variable capture issues in loops |
| 28-02 | Document C backend circuit() reset bug rather than attempting fix | C backend memory management fix is risky and time-consuming, beyond v1.5 scope |
| 29-01 | Defer BUG-01 and BUG-02 fixes, create test files only | Investigation revealed root cause is C backend QFT arithmetic (BUG-04), not Python operator logic |
| 29-01 | tests/bugfix/ directory for bug reproduction tests | Separate targeted bug tests from exhaustive verification tests |
| 29-02 | Use MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE for multiplication num_layer allocation | Conservative but safe - formula-based calculation was insufficient |
| 29-02 | Increase per-layer gate allocation to 10*bits | Progressive testing showed 2*bits, 3*bits, 4*bits all still segfaulted |
| 29-02 | Accept partial fixes for both BUG-03 and BUG-04 | Segfault fixed (primary goal), logic bugs documented for future work |
| 29-03 | Fix bit-ordering with bin[bits-1-bit_idx] reversal | two_complement() returns MSB-first, QFT formula needs LSB-first iteration |
| 29-03 | Fix cache update to use rotations[i] not rotations[bits-i-1] | Must match initial build path indexing for gate value consistency |
| 29-03 | Verify formula against Qiskit reference | Analytical verification when BUG-05 prevents reliable test execution |
| 29-05 | Accept partial fix for BUG-03 multiplication | Investigation identified root cause but fix incomplete - document for future work |
| 29-05 | Disable GCC LTO due to compiler bug | GCC 15 -flto triggers internal error, disabled until toolchain fixed |
| 29-04 | BUG-04 fix scope limited to CQ_add only | QQ_add (qint+qint) uses different implementation, needs separate fix |
| 29-04 | BUG-01 and BUG-02 remain blocked by incomplete BUG-04 | Cannot test/fix until QQ_add bit-ordering corrected |

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known C backend bugs (v1.5 targets):**
- **BUG-05 (CRITICAL):** circuit() does not properly reset state - causes memory explosion, blocks exhaustive testing AND prevents verification of fixes
- **BUG-04 (PARTIALLY FIXED):** CQ_add bit-ordering fixed (29-03), but QQ_add still broken - qint+qint addition/subtraction fails
- **BUG-03 (INVESTIGATED):** Multiplication returns 0 - root cause identified (bit-ordering), fix attempted but still fails (29-05)
- **BUG-01 (BLOCKED):** Subtraction underflow (3-7 returns 7 instead of 12) - blocked by QQ_add fix needed (29-04)
- **BUG-02 (BLOCKED):** Less-or-equal comparison (5<=5 returns 0) - transitively blocked by BUG-01 (29-04)

**Known pre-existing issues (not v1.5 scope):**
- Nested quantum conditionals require quantum-quantum AND
- Build system: pip install -e . fails with absolute path error
- Some tests/python/ tests cause segfaults during execution (discovered in 28-02, pre-existing)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-30
Stopped at: Completed Phase 29-04 (BUG-01 & BUG-02 investigation, remain blocked by QQ_add)
Resume file: None
Resume action: Fix QQ_add bit-ordering (similar to CQ_add fix from 29-03), then retest BUG-01 and BUG-02
