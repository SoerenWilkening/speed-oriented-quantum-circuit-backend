## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 52-01 | Only track forward calls when ancillas allocated | In-place functions without ancillas don't need tracking; avoids false double-forward errors in nested compilation |
| 52-01 | f.inverse is @property returning _AncillaInverseProxy | Enables f.inverse(x) call syntax without parentheses for getter |
| 52-01 | f.adjoint is @property returning _InverseCompiledFunc | Standalone adjoint with fresh ancillas, no forward call tracking |
| 52-02 | Qiskit test uses structural verification not simulation | Circuit-level gate scheduling differences between forward and inverse paths |
| 53-01 | Auto-uncompute triggers in __call__ after both replay and capture paths | qubit_saving variable already computed for cache key; forward call record exists after both paths |
| 53-01 | Cache key includes qubit_saving mode | Mode change triggers recompilation with different optimization |
| 53-01 | Functions modifying inputs skip auto-uncompute | Uncomputing temp ancillas would undo input modifications |
| 53-02 | complex_fn pattern (two allocations) needed for auto-uncompute tests | Simple copy pattern creates no temp qubits distinct from return |
| 53-02 | Verify deallocation via total_deallocations stat | More reliable than current_in_use for non-contiguous qubit deallocation |
| 54-01 | Use iteration protocol for qarray cdef access | _elements is cdef attribute; for elem in arr uses __iter__ which accesses _elements internally |
| 54-01 | Cache key uses ('arr', length) tuple for qarray | Distinguishes qarray from qint widths; array length determines cache hit/miss |
| 54-01 | Store return_type and element widths in CompiledBlock | Enables qarray reconstruction during replay without original qarray reference |
| 54-02 | qarray constructor uses integer list with width param | ql.qarray([1,2,3], width=4) not ql.qarray([qint(), ...]) |

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward:**
- BUG-DIV-02: MSB comparison leak in division
- BUG-MOD-REDUCE: _reduce_mod result corruption (needs different circuit structure)
- BUG-COND-MUL-01: Controlled multiplication corruption (not yet investigated)
- BUG-WIDTH-ADD: Mixed-width QFT addition off-by-one (discovered in v1.8)
