# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** v1.5 Bug Fixes & Exhaustive Verification -- Phase 28: Verification Framework & Init

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Milestone decisions archived. See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**Recent (Phase 28):**

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 28-01 | Separate tests/conftest.py for verification tests vs tests/python/conftest.py for unit tests | Keep fixture namespaces distinct, avoid conflicts between test categories |
| 28-01 | verify_circuit returns (actual, expected) tuple instead of asserting directly | Gives tests flexibility in assertion style and failure message formatting |
| 28-01 | Exhaustive testing threshold at 4 bits, sampled testing for 5+ bits | Balance coverage (all 256 pairs at 4-bit) vs runtime (sampled edge cases + random at higher widths) |
| 28-01 | Deterministic sampling with random.seed(42) | Reproducible test cases across runs for debugging |
| 28-02 | Generate parametrize data at module level via helper functions | Clean test structure, avoids pytest collection overhead from dynamic generation |
| 28-02 | Use default argument binding in circuit_builder closures | Avoids Python closure variable capture issues in loops |
| 28-02 | Document C backend circuit() reset bug rather than attempting fix | C backend memory management fix is risky and time-consuming, beyond v1.5 scope |

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known C backend bugs (v1.5 targets):**
- BUG-01: Subtraction underflow (3-7 returns 7 instead of 12)
- BUG-02: Less-or-equal comparison (5<=5 returns 0)
- BUG-03: Multiplication segfaults at certain widths
- BUG-04: QFT addition fails with both nonzero operands
- BUG-05: circuit() does not properly reset state - gates accumulate across calls (discovered in 28-02)

**Known pre-existing issues (not v1.5 scope):**
- Nested quantum conditionals require quantum-quantum AND
- Build system: pip install -e . fails with absolute path error
- Some tests/python/ tests cause segfaults during execution (discovered in 28-02, pre-existing)

## Session Continuity
