## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 21-01 | Accessor functions for global state | Cython cdef module variables cannot be cimported across modules |
| 21-01 | array() requires explicit dtype in _core | Function references qint/qbool which don't exist until full package import |
| 21-01 | Empty __init__.pxd for package cimport | Enables `from quantum_language cimport ...` syntax |
| 21-02 | Keep all operations in qint.pyx | RESEARCH.md permits large files for cohesion; splitting would break logical grouping |
| 21-02 | Use accessor functions for global state | Clean cross-module state access without cdef variable duplication |
| 21-03 | Re-export pattern for state subpackage | Simpler than separate qpu.pyx/uncompute.pyx - avoids cdef global state duplication |
| 21-03 | array() wrapper in __init__.py | Injects default dtype=qint - avoids circular import between _core and qint |
| 21-03 | Dual access pattern for state functions | Both ql.circuit_stats() and ql.state.circuit_stats() work - user preference |
| 21-04 | Include "." in include_dirs | Enables cimport to find .pxd files in package structure |
| 21-04 | Legacy fallback in setup.py | Smooth transition while Wave 2 completes - auto-switches when src/ exists |
| 21-04 | Package data includes .pxd files | Enables external projects to cimport quantum_language modules |
| 21-05 | pytest.ini pythonpath = src | Centralized PYTHONPATH config for src-layout packages - cleaner than sys.path in tests |
| 21-05 | Export AVAILABLE_PASSES from __init__.py | Required for circuit.optimize() API - users need pass names |
| 21-06 | Extract methods to .pxi include files | Cython include files allow splitting cdef class across files while maintaining single compilation unit |
| 21-06 | Preserve exact implementations in .pxi | Complete method extraction with docstrings and internal calls - no imports or class declarations |
| 21-07 | Cython include pattern not viable for cdef classes | Discovered Cython 3.x limitation: include directives not supported inside cdef class definitions |
| 21-07 | Keep qint.pyx as single file | Accept ~2400 lines for cohesion - Cython include pattern proved incompatible with cdef classes |
| 22-01 | Flattened storage with shape metadata | Arrays store elements as 1D list with shape tuple - simplifies access and matches NumPy internal representation |
| 22-01 | Width inference using bit_length() with INTEGERSIZE floor | Auto-detect bit width from max value, always use at least INTEGERSIZE=8 bits - minimizes qubits while preventing over-narrow types |
| 22-01 | Virtual Sequence registration instead of inheritance | Cython extension types cannot inherit from Python ABCs - use Sequence.register(qarray) for protocol compliance |
| 22-02 | Single int on multi-dimensional array returns row view | NumPy compatibility - arr[0] on 2D array returns first row, not flattened element |
| 22-02 | View arrays created via qarray.__new__() | Manual cdef attribute initialization required for Cython extension types |
| 22-02 | Multi-dimensional indexing uses _multi_to_flat | Row-major index calculation converts (i,j) coordinates to flat index using strides |
| 22-03 | Keyword-only parameters for width/dtype/dim | NumPy-style API design using * to force keyword-only parameters - prevents positional argument confusion |
| 22-03 | Homogeneity enforcement for qarray | Arrays must contain only qint OR only qbool, not both - simplifies element access and dtype is array-level property |
| 22-03 | NumPy dtype.itemsize for width inference | Use dtype.itemsize * 8 (bytes to bits) for width calculation - direct mapping from NumPy types |
| 22-03 | dim/data mutual exclusivity | Specifying both raises ValueError - dimension-based creates zeros, data-based uses values (ambiguous semantics) |

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known pre-existing issues:**
- Multiplication tests segfault at certain widths (C backend issue, tracked)
- Nested quantum conditionals require quantum-quantum AND implementation
- Some tests fail with MemoryError due to cumulative qubit allocation across test suite
- Circuit allocator errors in some test combinations

**Known limitations (acceptable by design):**
- qint_mod * qint_mod raises NotImplementedError
- apply_merge() placeholder for phase rotation merging
- Cython include directives not supported for cdef class method injection (Cython 3.x design constraint)
