# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** v8.0 Quantum Chess Walk Rewrite -- Phase 113

## Current Position

Phase: 113 of 116 (Diffusion Redesign Move Enumeration)
Plan: 1 of 1 complete
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-03-08 -- Completed 113-01 (build_move_table for position-independent move enumeration)

Progress: [##########] 96%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Chess walk must evaluate move legality in superposition (not classical pre-filtering)
- Knights + Kings move types for v8.0 (non-sliding pieces only)
- All predicates must use standard ql constructs -- no raw gate emission for application logic
- Diffusion must use arithmetic counting circuit (not O(2^d_max) enumeration)
- Compile infrastructure qubit_set operations to use numpy
- DAGNode dual-storage: frozenset qubit_set for API compat, numpy _qubit_array for fast overlap
- Bitmask stays Python int (>64 qubit arbitrary precision), only overlap uses numpy
- Numpy qubit_set construction shows negligible perf difference at current sizes, justified by architectural consistency
- _build_qubit_set_numpy centralizes all qubit set construction in compile.py
- No edge-of-board filtering in move table -- quantum predicate handles legality
- 8 entries per piece in move table (knights and kings both have 8 offsets)
- [Phase 113]: No edge-of-board filtering in move table -- quantum predicate handles legality

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward (architectural):**
- 14-15 pre-existing test failures in test_compile.py -- unrelated to v8.0
- Diffusion combinatorial explosion is a hard blocker for large branching (Phase 113 addresses)
- MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE (300K) may be exceeded by chess circuits -- assess in Phase 113
- Nested `with qbool:` limitation requires flat Toffoli-AND predicate design
