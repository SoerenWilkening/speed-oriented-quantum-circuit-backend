# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** Write quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.
**Current focus:** v4.1 Quality & Efficiency -- Phase 83 (Tech Debt Cleanup)

## Current Position

Phase: 83 of 89 (Tech Debt Cleanup) -- IN PROGRESS
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (83-02 complete)
Status: Phase 83 plan 02 complete
Last activity: 2026-02-23 -- Completed 83-02 (dead code removal & sequence generation docs)

Progress: [======                                            ] 1/8 phases (v4.1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**Phase 82-01:**
- pyproject.toml is single source of truth for dependencies (removed install_requires/extras_require from setup.py)
- pytest-cov in dev extras; sim_backend.py with lazy cached import guards
- QUANTUM_COVERAGE env var separate from QUANTUM_PROFILE

**Phase 82-02:**
- Python-level coverage baseline (not Cython linetrace) due to extreme overhead (~100x slowdown)
- Segfault-causing array/qarray tests excluded from coverage runs (known Phase 87 bug)
- Incremental batch coverage collection to avoid segfault data loss
- Baseline: 48.2% coverage, top priorities: compile.py (314 missing), draw.py (200 missing, 0%)

**Phase 83-02:**
- Vulture found zero dead code at >=80% confidence; all 60% findings confirmed false positives (used from .pyx files, tests, or public API)
- Active generator scripts already had comprehensive docstrings and argparse; no changes needed
- Deprecation pattern: docstring notice + warnings.warn() after imports

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward (all addressed in v4.1 phases):**
- BUG-CQQ-QFT -> Phase 86 (root cause, must fix before BUG-QFT-DIV)
- BUG-WIDTH-ADD -> Phase 86 (root cause)
- BUG-QFT-DIV -> Phase 86 (compound bug, resolves after root causes)
- BUG-DIV-02 -> Phase 86 (MSB comparison leak)
- BUG-COND-MUL-01 -> Phase 87 (scope/lifecycle, after QFT stable)
- BUG-MOD-REDUCE -> Phase 87 (may defer -- needs Beauregard redesign)
- 32-bit segfault -> Phase 87 (MAXLAYERINSEQUENCE fix)

### Research Flags

- Phase 86 (QFT Bug Fixes): HIGH risk -- CCP rotation audit needed
- Phase 87 (BUG-MOD-REDUCE): HIGH risk if attempted -- algorithm redesign
- Phase 85 (Optimizer): MEDIUM risk -- golden-master capture first

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-23
Stopped at: Completed 83-02-PLAN.md
Resume action: Continue Phase 83 (next plan: 83-01 if not yet done, or next phase)
