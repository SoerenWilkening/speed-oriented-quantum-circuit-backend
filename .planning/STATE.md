## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 52-01 | Only track forward calls when ancillas allocated | In-place functions without ancillas don't need tracking; avoids false double-forward errors in nested compilation |
| 52-01 | f.inverse is @property returning _AncillaInverseProxy | Enables f.inverse(x) call syntax without parentheses for getter |
| 52-01 | f.adjoint is @property returning _InverseCompiledFunc | Standalone adjoint with fresh ancillas, no forward call tracking |
| 52-02 | Qiskit test uses structural verification not simulation | Circuit-level gate scheduling differences between forward and inverse paths |
| 53-01 | Auto-uncompute triggers in __call__ after both replay and capture paths | qubit_saving variable already computed for cache key; forward call record exists after both paths |
| 53-01 | Cache key includes qubit_saving mode | Mode change triggers recompilation with different optimization |
| 53-01 | Functions modifying inputs skip auto-uncompute | Uncomputing temp ancillas would undo input modifications |

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carry forward:**
- BUG-DIV-02: MSB comparison leak in division
- BUG-MOD-REDUCE: _reduce_mod result corruption (needs different circuit structure)
- BUG-COND-MUL-01: Controlled multiplication corruption (not yet investigated)
- BUG-WIDTH-ADD: Mixed-width QFT addition off-by-one (discovered in v1.8)
