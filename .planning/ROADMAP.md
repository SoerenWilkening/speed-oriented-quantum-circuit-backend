### v6.0 Quantum Walk Primitives (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Predicate-aware quantum walk operators based on Montanaro 2015 backtracking speedup, with variable branching, correct amplitude calculation, and Qiskit-verified demos on small SAT instances.

- [ ] **Phase 97: Tree Encoding & Predicate Interface** - Foundational data structures, register allocation, predicate API, and resource estimation
- [ ] **Phase 98: Local Diffusion Operator** - D_x with correct amplitude angles for uniform branching, root special case, and statevector verification
- [ ] **Phase 99: Walk Operators** - R_A, R_B via parity-controlled diffusion, composed walk step, @ql.compile wrapping, disjointness validation
- [ ] **Phase 100: Variable Branching** - Dynamic child counting via predicate evaluation and controlled Ry rotation based on d(x)
- [ ] **Phase 101: Detection & Demo** - Iterative power-method detection, SAT demo within 17-qubit budget, Qiskit statevector verification

## Phase Details

### Phase 97: Tree Encoding & Predicate Interface
**Goal**: Users can create a QuantumBacktrackingTree with correct register layout and define accept/reject predicates that are validated before circuit construction
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v6.0)
**Requirements**: TREE-01, TREE-02, TREE-03, PRED-01, PRED-02, PRED-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can instantiate QuantumBacktrackingTree(max_depth, branching_degree) and it allocates one-hot height register (max_depth+1 qubits) plus QuantumArray branch registers (one per depth level)
  2. User can call the resource estimator with tree parameters and receive exact qubit count; estimator raises an error before circuit construction if budget exceeds 17 qubits
  3. User can prepare the root state (height qubit set, branch registers initialized) and verify via statevector that the root is correctly encoded
  4. User can pass a predicate callable returning (is_accept, is_reject) qbools and the framework validates mutual exclusion (both cannot be true simultaneously)
  5. Predicate uncomputation works correctly via raw allocation or @ql.compile inverse pattern without conflicting with LIFO scope tracking
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 97-01: TBD
- [ ] 97-02: TBD
- [ ] 97-03: TBD

### Phase 98: Local Diffusion Operator
**Goal**: Users can apply verified-correct local diffusion D_x to any tree node with proper amplitude coefficients
**Depends on**: Phase 97
**Requirements**: DIFF-01, DIFF-02, DIFF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Local diffusion D_x for uniform branching uses phi = 2*arctan(sqrt(d)) and produces amplitudes matching 1/sqrt(d(x)+1) for parent and each child (the "+1" includes the parent node)
  2. Root node diffusion uses a separate phi_root formula (different amplitude weighting per Montanaro section 2) and is controlled on the root height qubit h[max_depth]
  3. Statevector tests confirm |psi_x> amplitudes match the 1/sqrt(d(x)+1) tolerance for non-root nodes and the correct root formula for the root node
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 98-01: TBD
- [ ] 98-02: TBD

### Phase 99: Walk Operators
**Goal**: Users can apply the complete walk step U = R_B * R_A as a compiled, cacheable operation with verified qubit disjointness between R_A and R_B
**Depends on**: Phase 98
**Requirements**: WALK-01, WALK-02, WALK-03, WALK-04, WALK-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. R_A applies local diffusions at even-depth nodes via height-parity control, and R_B applies local diffusions at odd-depth nodes plus root reflection via height-parity control
  2. Qubit disjointness test confirms R_A and R_B operate on zero overlapping qubit indices (structural correctness of the product-of-reflections)
  3. Walk step U = R_B * R_A is wrapped in @ql.compile and the controlled variant is accessible for phase estimation
  4. Applying the walk step to a known tree state produces the expected statevector transformation (verified via Qiskit simulation)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 99-01: TBD
- [ ] 99-02: TBD

### Phase 100: Variable Branching
**Goal**: Walk operators support trees where different nodes have different numbers of valid children, with amplitude angles computed dynamically from predicate evaluation
**Depends on**: Phase 99
**Requirements**: DIFF-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Variable branching counts valid children per node by evaluating the predicate on each potential child and produces the correct d(x) count
  2. Controlled Ry rotation applies the angle phi = 2*arctan(sqrt(d(x))) conditioned on the child count d(x), so nodes with fewer valid children get different diffusion amplitudes
  3. Statevector tests confirm correct amplitudes for a tree where different nodes have different branching factors (at least one node pruned vs. one node fully branching)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 100-01: TBD
- [ ] 100-02: TBD

### Phase 101: Detection & Demo
**Goal**: Users can detect whether a solution exists in a backtracking tree, verified end-to-end on a small SAT instance within the 17-qubit simulator ceiling
**Depends on**: Phase 100
**Requirements**: DET-01, DET-02, DET-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Iterative power-method detection algorithm applies walk step powers, measures, and correctly identifies solution existence when threshold probability exceeds 3/8
  2. Demo runs on a small SAT instance (binary tree depth 2-3, within 17-qubit budget) and correctly detects the known solution
  3. Qiskit statevector verification confirms detection probability is above threshold on a known-solution instance and below threshold on a no-solution instance
  4. Detection returns false (no false positive) on a tree with no satisfying assignment
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 101-01: TBD
- [ ] 101-02: TBD
