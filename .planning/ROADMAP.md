### v9.0 Nested Controls & Chess Engine (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Enable arbitrary-depth nested `with qbool:` blocks via Toffoli AND control composition, fix 2D qarray support, and rewrite the chess engine in readable natural-programming style.

- [x] **Phase 117: Control Stack Infrastructure** - Replace flat control globals with stack and add Toffoli AND helpers (completed 2026-03-09)
- [ ] **Phase 118: Nested With-Block Rewrite** - Rewrite `__enter__`/`__exit__` with push/pop semantics and AND-ancilla lifecycle
- [ ] **Phase 119: Compile Compatibility** - Verify and fix `@ql.compile` with nested control contexts
- [ ] **Phase 120: 2D Qarray Support** - Fix 2D qarray construction and indexing
- [ ] **Phase 121: Chess Engine Rewrite** - Rewrite chess engine in readable natural-programming style with nested `with` blocks

## Phase Details

### Phase 117: Control Stack Infrastructure
**Goal**: Framework has a control stack data structure and Toffoli AND emission primitives that all downstream features depend on
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase in v9.0)
**Requirements**: CTRL-02, CTRL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `_control_stack` list replaces flat `_controlled`/`_control_bool` globals with backward-compatible accessor wrappers (`_get_controlled()` and `_get_control_bool()` work identically for single-level use)
  2. `emit_ccx` function emits a Toffoli gate directly without going through the heavyweight `&` operator
  3. `_toffoli_and` / `_uncompute_toffoli_and` helpers allocate an AND-ancilla qubit and clean it up via reverse Toffoli
  4. Existing single-level `with` blocks still produce correct circuits (stack depth 0 and 1 behave identically to old globals)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 117-01-PLAN.md -- Control stack global + gate emission primitives (emit_ccx, _toffoli_and, _uncompute_toffoli_and)
- [ ] 117-02-PLAN.md -- Wire stack into __enter__/__exit__, compile.py, oracle.py + regression verification

### Phase 118: Nested With-Block Rewrite
**Goal**: Users can nest `with qbool:` blocks at arbitrary depth with correct multi-controlled gate emission and automatic ancilla cleanup
**Depends on**: Phase 117
**Requirements**: CTRL-01, CTRL-04, CTRL-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `with a: with b: x += 1` produces a doubly-controlled addition (two control qubits composed via Toffoli AND into a combined control ancilla)
  2. Controlled XOR (`~qbool`) works inside `with` blocks without raising NotImplementedError
  3. All existing single-level `with` block tests pass with zero regressions
  4. The 6 xfail tests in `test_nested_with_blocks.py` pass (xfail markers removed)
  5. 3+ level nesting produces correct multi-controlled circuits (each level adds one AND-ancilla)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 118-01: TBD
- [ ] 118-02: TBD

### Phase 119: Compile Compatibility
**Goal**: `@ql.compile` captured functions work correctly inside nested `with` blocks
**Depends on**: Phase 118
**Requirements**: CTRL-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A compiled function called inside a 2-level nested `with` block emits all gates with the correct combined control qubit
  2. Controlled variant derivation handles the AND-ancilla as control qubit during both capture and replay
  3. Compile save/restore correctly preserves and restores the full control stack (not just top entry)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 119-01: TBD

### Phase 120: 2D Qarray Support
**Goal**: Users can create and index 2D quantum arrays for board-like data structures
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phases 117-119, must complete before Phase 121)
**Requirements**: ARR-01, ARR-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `ql.qarray(dim=(8, 8), dtype=ql.qbool)` creates a 64-element qarray accessible as a 2D grid without TypeError
  2. `arr[r, c]` reads the correct element and `arr[r, c] |= flag` mutates it in place
  3. Existing 1D qarray tests pass with zero regressions
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 120-01: TBD

### Phase 121: Chess Engine Rewrite
**Goal**: A readable chess engine example demonstrates the full v9.0 feature set in natural-programming style
**Depends on**: Phase 118, Phase 119, Phase 120
**Requirements**: CHESS-01, CHESS-02, CHESS-03, CHESS-04, CHESS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `examples/chess_engine.py` reads like pseudocode -- nested `with` blocks for conditionals, 2D qarrays for the board, arithmetic operators for move logic
  2. The engine compiles with `@ql.compile(opt=1)` without OOM errors
  3. Move legality checking (piece-exists, no-friendly-capture, check detection) is implemented using nested `with` blocks and compiled sub-predicates
  4. Walk operators (R_A, R_B) and diffusion are present in readable style matching the framework's natural-programming paradigm
  5. Running the script produces circuit statistics (gate count, depth, qubit count) without requiring quantum simulation
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 121-01: TBD
- [ ] 121-02: TBD

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 117 -> 118 -> 119 -> 120 -> 121
(Phase 120 is independent and can execute in parallel with 117-119 if desired)
