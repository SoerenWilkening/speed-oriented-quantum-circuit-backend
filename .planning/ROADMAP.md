### v8.0 Quantum Chess Walk Rewrite (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Rewrite the chess quantum walk to evaluate move legality in superposition using quantum predicates built from standard ql constructs, replace classical pre-filtering with all-moves enumeration and quantum validity checking, redesign diffusion for large branching factors, and optimize compile infrastructure with numpy-based qubit set operations.

- [x] **Phase 112: Compile Infrastructure Optimization** - Numpy-based qubit set operations in compile.py and call_graph.py with profiled before/after validation (completed 2026-03-08)
- [x] **Phase 113: Diffusion Redesign & Move Enumeration** - Arithmetic counting circuit replacing combinatorial diffusion explosion, plus all-moves enumeration table (completed 2026-03-08)
- [x] **Phase 114: Core Quantum Predicates** - Piece-exists and no-friendly-capture predicates using standard ql constructs with @ql.compile(inverse=True) (completed 2026-03-08)
- [ ] **Phase 115: Check Detection & Combined Predicate** - King-safety predicate via attack tables and combined move legality predicate composing all conditions
- [ ] **Phase 116: Walk Integration & Demo** - Full walk rewrite replacing classical pre-filtering with quantum predicates, end-to-end demo as framework showcase

## Phase Details

### Phase 112: Compile Infrastructure Optimization
**Goal**: Compile infrastructure uses numpy for qubit set operations, reducing Python loop overhead in compile.py and call_graph.py
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of chess features)
**Requirements**: COMP-01, COMP-02, COMP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. compile.py qubit_set construction uses numpy operations (np.unique/np.concatenate) instead of Python set.update() loops
  2. call_graph.py DAGNode overlap computation uses numpy arrays (np.intersect1d) for pairwise qubit overlap detection
  3. All existing compile tests (186+ invocations) pass with zero regressions after numpy migration
  4. Profiling data shows measurable improvement (or documents that overhead is negligible for current workload sizes)
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 112-01-PLAN.md — Profiling baseline and call_graph.py numpy overlap migration
- [ ] 112-02-PLAN.md — compile.py numpy qubit_set construction and post-migration profiling

### Phase 113: Diffusion Redesign & Move Enumeration
**Goal**: Walk circuits can handle large branching factors (100+ children) without combinatorial explosion, and all geometrically possible moves are enumerated for quantum evaluation
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phase 112)
**Requirements**: WALK-01, WALK-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All-moves enumeration table contains every geometrically possible (piece_type, src, dst) triple for knights (up to 8 per square) and kings (up to 8 per square) without legality filtering
  2. Diffusion operator uses an arithmetic counting circuit (summing validity bits into a count register) instead of O(2^d_max) itertools.combinations pattern enumeration
  3. Diffusion circuit generation is O(d_max) in gate count — no exponential or superlinear blowup
  4. Existing walk tests continue to pass (diffusion redesign does not break SAT demo or small-board cases)
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 113-01-PLAN.md — All-moves enumeration table builder (build_move_table in chess_encoding.py)
- [ ] 113-02-PLAN.md — Counting-based diffusion replacing combinatorial enumeration in walk.py
- [ ] 113-03-PLAN.md — Wire chess_walk.py to shared counting diffusion and cleanup

### Phase 114: Core Quantum Predicates
**Goal**: Users can evaluate piece-exists and no-friendly-capture conditions in superposition using standard ql constructs
**Depends on**: Nothing (uses existing framework primitives)
**Requirements**: PRED-01, PRED-02, PRED-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Quantum piece-exists predicate checks whether a specific piece type occupies a source square via `with` conditional on board qarray elements, returning a qbool result
  2. Quantum no-friendly-capture predicate rejects moves where target square is occupied by same-color piece, using `with` conditional on board qarray elements
  3. Both predicates use `@ql.compile(inverse=True)` for automatic ancilla uncomputation and compiled replay
  4. Predicates produce correct results verified against classical equivalents on small boards (2x2 or 3x3) within 17-qubit simulation limit
  5. All predicate logic uses standard ql constructs (with qbool:, operator overloading, @ql.compile) -- no raw gate emission for application logic
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 114-01-PLAN.md — Piece-exists predicate factory with test suite and statevector verification
- [ ] 114-02-PLAN.md — No-friendly-capture predicate factory with classical equivalence tests

### Phase 115: Check Detection & Combined Predicate
**Goal**: Users can evaluate full move legality including king safety in superposition, with all conditions composed into a single predicate
**Depends on**: Phase 114
**Requirements**: PRED-03, PRED-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Check detection predicate verifies king is not in check after a move using pre-computed attack tables (knight L-shapes + king adjacency) evaluated via `with` conditionals on board qarray
  2. Combined move legality predicate composes piece-exists, no-friendly-capture, and check detection using standard `with qbool:` conditional nesting and boolean operators
  3. Combined predicate returns a single qbool indicating full move legality, usable as a validity flag for walk branching
  4. All predicates verified correct against classical equivalents on small boards within 17-qubit simulation limit
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 115-01-PLAN.md — Check detection predicate factory with attack table precomputation and statevector tests
- [ ] 115-02-PLAN.md — Combined move legality predicate composing all three sub-predicates via & operator

### Phase 116: Walk Integration & Demo
**Goal**: Chess quantum walk evaluates move legality in superposition using quantum predicates instead of classical pre-filtering, serving as a showcase of the framework's expressiveness
**Depends on**: Phase 113, Phase 115
**Requirements**: WALK-02, WALK-04, WALK-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. evaluate_children calls the quantum legality predicate per move candidate instead of the trivial always-valid check from v6.1
  2. Rewritten chess_walk.py integrates quantum predicates, all-moves enumeration, and redesigned diffusion into a complete walk step U = R_B * R_A
  3. End-to-end demo generates a valid quantum circuit for the chess walk on a KNK (king-knight-king) position with quantum legality evaluation
  4. All quantum logic in the demo uses standard ql constructs (with qbool:, operator overloading, @ql.compile, ql.array) -- no raw gate emission for application logic
  5. Demo produces circuit statistics (qubit count, gate count, depth) demonstrating the walk circuit is constructible
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 116-01: TBD
- [ ] 116-02: TBD
