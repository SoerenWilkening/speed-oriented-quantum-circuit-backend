### v7.0 Compile Infrastructure (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Restructure `@ql.compile` from monolithic circuit generation to a multi-level compilation model with call graph DAG, selective sequence merging, and DOT visualization.

- [ ] **Phase 107: Call Graph DAG Foundation** - opt_flag API, DAG construction with qubit overlap edges, backward compat
- [ ] **Phase 108: Call Graph Analysis & Visualization** - Per-node stats extraction, aggregate metrics, DOT export, compilation report
- [ ] **Phase 109: Selective Sequence Merging** - opt_flag=2 with merge candidate detection, correct merging, cross-boundary optimization
- [ ] **Phase 110: Merge Verification & Regression** - Qiskit simulation equivalence, full test suite regression

## Phase Details

### Phase 107: Call Graph DAG Foundation
**Goal**: Users can compile functions at multiple optimization levels with a call graph DAG capturing program structure
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v7.0)
**Requirements**: CAPI-01, CAPI-03, CAPI-04, CGRAPH-01, CGRAPH-02, CGRAPH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can write `@ql.compile(opt=1)` and get a CallGraphDAG object alongside the compiled function
  2. User can write `@ql.compile(opt=3)` and get identical behavior to existing `@ql.compile()` (full expansion)
  3. All 106+ existing compile tests pass unchanged when opt=3 is the default
  4. Call graph DAG contains nodes with qubit sets, and edges weighted by shared qubit count between dependent sequences
  5. Parallel sequences (disjoint qubit sets) are identified as concurrent groups in the DAG
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 107-01-PLAN.md -- CallGraphDAG module with DAGNode, overlap edges, parallel groups, builder stack
- [ ] 107-02-PLAN.md -- Wire opt parameter into compile.py, DAG building in __call__, backward compat + integration tests

### Phase 108: Call Graph Analysis & Visualization
**Goal**: Users can extract actionable metrics from the call graph and visualize program structure as DOT
**Depends on**: Phase 107
**Requirements**: CGRAPH-04, CGRAPH-05, VIS-01, VIS-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can extract gate count, depth, qubit count, and T-count per node from the call graph without building a full circuit
  2. User can compute aggregate totals (gates, depth, T-count) across the full call graph
  3. User can call an API (e.g., `compiled_func.call_graph.to_dot()`) and receive a valid DOT string with labeled nodes and edges
  4. User can view a compilation report showing per-node stats including parallel group membership
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 108-01: TBD
- [ ] 108-02: TBD

### Phase 109: Selective Sequence Merging
**Goal**: Users can merge overlapping-qubit sequences for cross-boundary gate optimization
**Depends on**: Phase 108
**Requirements**: CAPI-02, MERGE-01, MERGE-02, MERGE-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can write `@ql.compile(opt=2)` and overlapping-qubit sequences are automatically identified and merged
  2. Merged sequences produce correct quantum states (per-qubit gate ordering preserved)
  3. Cross-boundary optimizations fire (e.g., QFT at end of sequence A cancels IQFT at start of sequence B)
  4. Non-overlapping sequences remain independent (no unnecessary merging)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 109-01: TBD
- [ ] 109-02: TBD

### Phase 110: Merge Verification & Regression
**Goal**: Merged circuits are proven correct via simulation and the full test suite passes at all opt levels
**Depends on**: Phase 109
**Requirements**: MERGE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Merged circuit output verified equivalent to sequential execution via Qiskit statevector simulation for arithmetic workloads (add, mul, grover oracle)
  2. All 106+ existing compile tests pass at opt=1, opt=2, and opt=3
  3. Parametric compilation works correctly at each opt level (no topology corruption from merge)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 110-01: TBD
- [ ] 110-02: TBD
