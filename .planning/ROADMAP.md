### v2.3 Hardcoding Right-Sizing (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Benchmark hardcoded vs dynamic gate sequence generation, right-size or eliminate hardcoded sequences based on data, and evaluate whether other operations warrant hardcoding.

- [x] **Phase 62: Measurement** - Benchmark all generation paths and evaluate other operations for hardcoding viability -- completed 2026-02-08
- [ ] **Phase 63: Right-Sizing Implementation** - Apply data-driven decisions to right-size addition sequences
- [ ] **Phase 64: Regression Verification** - Confirm no performance regression after changes

## Phase Details

### Phase 62: Measurement
**Goal**: Comprehensive benchmarks quantify the cost/benefit of hardcoded sequences for all operation types, producing a data-driven recommendation
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v2.3)
**Requirements**: BENCH-01, BENCH-02, BENCH-03, BENCH-04, EVAL-01, EVAL-02, EVAL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running a benchmark script produces import time measurements with and without hardcoded sequences loaded, showing the cost in milliseconds
  2. Running a benchmark script produces per-operation first-call generation cost for all 9 operation types (QQ_add, CQ_add, cQQ_add, cCQ_add, QQ_mul, CQ_mul, Q_xor, Q_and, Q_or) at widths 1-16
  3. Running a benchmark script produces per-call dispatch overhead comparing hardcoded lookup vs dynamic cache hit, showing whether the difference is measurable
  4. A comparison report exists showing hardcoded vs dynamic cost per operation/width, with import time amortization analysis (break-even point in calls)
  5. Multiplication, bitwise, and division generation costs are each measured and documented with a clear keep/hardcode/skip recommendation
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 62-01-PLAN.md -- Benchmark measurement engine (BENCH-01, BENCH-02, BENCH-03)
- [x] 62-02-PLAN.md -- Evaluation and comparison report (EVAL-01/02/03, BENCH-04)

### Phase 63: Right-Sizing Implementation
**Goal**: Addition hardcoded sequences are right-sized (kept, factored, or removed) based on Phase 62 measurements
**Depends on**: Phase 62
**Requirements**: ADD-01, ADD-02, ADD-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A documented decision exists stating which addition widths (if any) remain hardcoded, with data justification from Phase 62 benchmarks
  2. If hardcoded sequences are kept: shared QFT/IQFT sub-sequences are factored out, reducing total generated C file size measurably
  3. If hardcoded sequences are removed: all hardcoded sequence files are deleted, the build system no longer references them, and dynamic generation handles all widths
  4. The existing test suite (`pytest tests/python/ -v`) passes after implementation changes
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 64: Regression Verification
**Goal**: End-to-end circuit generation performance is verified to have no regression after right-sizing changes
**Depends on**: Phase 63
**Requirements**: ADD-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A benchmark comparing circuit generation throughput before and after changes shows no regression (or documents acceptable trade-offs with justification)
  2. The full test suite passes with zero new failures compared to the v2.2 baseline
**Plans**: TBD
