### 🚧 v1.1 QPU State Removal & Comparison Refactoring (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Remove global state dependency (QPU_state R0-R3 registers) and refactor comparison operations for cleaner architecture and efficient implementation.

- [ ] **Phase 11: Global State Removal** - Remove QPU_state global dependency
- [ ] **Phase 12: Comparison Function Refactoring** - Refactor comparison functions to pass values explicitly
- [ ] **Phase 13: Equality Comparison** - Implement qint == int and qint == qint
- [ ] **Phase 14: Ordering Comparisons** - Refactor <= and >= for efficiency
- [ ] **Phase 15: Classical Initialization** - Initialize qint with classical values

## Phase Details

### Phase 11: Global State Removal
**Goal:** Remove QPU_state global dependency from C backend, eliminating the last remnant of global state
**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase of v1.1)
**Requirements:** GLOB-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. QPU_state global variable and R0-R3 registers are completely removed from C backend
  2. All C functions that previously used QPU_state now use local variables or parameters
  3. All tests pass without any global state dependencies
  4. Memory leak checks confirm no leaked register qubits
**Plans:** 5 plans in 4 waves

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01-PLAN.md — Remove purely classical functions (CC_add, CC_mul, CC_equal, etc.)
- [ ] 11-02-PLAN.md — Refactor P_add/cP_add to take explicit phase parameter
- [ ] 11-03-PLAN.md — Refactor legacy logic functions to take explicit width/value parameters
- [ ] 11-04-PLAN.md — Remove QPU_state global, instruction_t type, and infrastructure
- [ ] 11-05-PLAN.md — Update Python bindings and verify full test suite

### Phase 12: Comparison Function Refactoring
**Goal:** Refactor comparison functions to take classical values as parameters instead of using global state
**Depends on:** Phase 11
**Requirements:** GLOB-02, GLOB-03, GLOB-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. CQ_equal takes classical value as explicit parameter (no global state)
  2. cCQ_equal takes classical value as explicit parameter (no global state)
  3. CC_equal is removed from codebase (purely classical, not needed for quantum operations)
  4. All existing comparison operations continue to work correctly
  5. Tests verify comparison functions work with explicit parameters
**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during plan-phase

### Phase 13: Equality Comparison
**Goal:** Implement efficient equality comparison for qint == int and qint == qint using refactored functions
**Depends on:** Phase 12
**Requirements:** COMP-01, COMP-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can compare qint == int and get correct quantum boolean result
  2. User can compare qint == qint and get correct result using (qint - qint) == 0 pattern
  3. Equality comparisons use refactored CQ_equal/cCQ_equal with explicit parameters
  4. Python operator overloading (__eq__) works correctly for both cases
  5. Tests verify equality comparisons for various bit widths and values
**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during plan-phase

### Phase 14: Ordering Comparisons
**Goal:** Refactor <= and >= operators to use in-place subtraction/addition without temporary qint allocation
**Depends on:** Phase 13
**Requirements:** COMP-03, COMP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can compare qint <= value without allocating temporary qint
  2. User can compare qint >= value without allocating temporary qint
  3. Ordering comparisons use in-place arithmetic operations for efficiency
  4. Python operator overloading (__le__, __ge__) works correctly
  5. Tests verify memory efficiency (no temp qint allocation during comparison)
**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during plan-phase

### Phase 15: Classical Initialization
**Goal:** Initialize qint with classical value by setting qubits to |1⟩ based on binary representation
**Depends on:** Phase 11 (independent of comparison refactoring)
**Requirements:** INIT-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can create qint with classical initial value (e.g., qint(5, 3) creates 3-bit qint initialized to 5)
  2. Initialization sets qubits to |1⟩ via Q_not based on binary representation
  3. Initialized qint can be used in arithmetic and comparison operations
  4. Tests verify correct initialization for various bit widths and values
**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during plan-phase
