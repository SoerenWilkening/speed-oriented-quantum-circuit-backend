### v2.0 Function Compilation (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** `@ql.compile` decorator that captures gate sequences on first call, optimizes them, and replays with qubit remapping on subsequent calls -- enabling compiled quantum functions that work inside controlled contexts and support inverse generation, nesting, and debug introspection.

- [ ] **Phase 48: Core Capture-Replay** - Cython infrastructure, decorator, gate capture/replay with qubit remapping and caching
- [ ] **Phase 49: Optimization & Uncomputation** - Optimize captured sequences and integrate with uncomputation tracking
- [ ] **Phase 50: Controlled Context** - Compiled functions work inside `with` blocks via re-capture with controlled cache keys
- [ ] **Phase 51: Differentiators & Polish** - Inverse generation, debug mode, nested compilation, and comprehensive test suite

## Phase Details

### Phase 48: Core Capture-Replay
**Goal**: Users can decorate a quantum function with `@ql.compile` and call it multiple times with different quantum arguments, getting correct results from cached gate replay with qubit remapping
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v2.0)
**Requirements**: CAP-01, CAP-02, CAP-03, CAP-04, CAP-05, CAP-06, INF-01, INF-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A function decorated with `@ql.compile` produces the same circuit output as the undecorated version on first call
  2. Calling the compiled function a second time with different qint arguments replays gates onto the new qubits (no re-execution of the function body)
  3. The returned qint/qbool from a compiled function is usable in subsequent quantum operations (arithmetic, comparisons, conditionals)
  4. Calling with different classical parameter values or different qint widths triggers re-capture (separate cache entries)
  5. Creating a new circuit via `ql.circuit()` invalidates the compilation cache
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 49: Optimization & Uncomputation
**Goal**: Captured gate sequences are optimized before caching, and compiled function outputs integrate correctly with the automatic uncomputation system
**Depends on**: Phase 48
**Requirements**: OPT-01, OPT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A compiled function produces fewer gates than the undecorated version (optimization applied to captured sequence)
  2. Replayed gates come from the optimized sequence, not the original unoptimized capture
  3. A qint returned from a compiled function is correctly uncomputed when it goes out of scope inside a `with` block
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 50: Controlled Context
**Goal**: Compiled functions work correctly inside `with` blocks, producing controlled gate variants
**Depends on**: Phase 49
**Requirements**: CTL-01, CTL-02, CTL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Calling a compiled function inside a `with qbool:` block produces controlled gates (verified via OpenQASM export or circuit inspection)
  2. The same compiled function called outside and inside a `with` block uses separate cache entries (controlled vs uncontrolled)
  3. Nested `with` blocks around compiled function calls produce the correct multi-controlled gates
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 51: Differentiators & Polish
**Goal**: Compiled functions support inverse generation, debug introspection, nesting, and the feature has comprehensive test coverage
**Depends on**: Phase 50
**Requirements**: INV-01, INV-02, DBG-01, DBG-02, NST-01, NST-02, INF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Calling `.inverse()` on a compiled function produces the adjoint of the compiled sequence (reversed gate order, adjoint transformations)
  2. Debug mode (`@ql.compile(debug=True)`) prints original operation count alongside optimized gate count and reports cache hits/misses
  3. A compiled function calling another compiled function produces correct results (inner function's replayed gates become part of outer capture)
  4. Comprehensive test suite covers all compilation scenarios: basic capture/replay, different widths, cache invalidation, controlled context, inverse, debug, and nesting
**Plans**: TBD
