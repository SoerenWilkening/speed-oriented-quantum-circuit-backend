# Roadmap: Quantum Assembly

## Overview

This roadmap transforms Quantum Assembly from a mid-restructuring prototype into a production-ready quantum programming framework. The journey follows a bottom-up approach: first establishing a solid C foundation by eliminating architectural anti-patterns (global state, memory bugs), then building variable-width integer support and complete arithmetic operations, and finally polishing the Python API with comprehensive documentation. Each phase delivers verifiable capabilities that build toward the core value: writing quantum algorithms in natural programming style that compiles to efficient, memory-optimized quantum circuits.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.
