    Returns a callable _verify(circuit_builder, width, in_place=False) that:
    1. Resets circuit state via ql.circuit()
    2. Builds circuit using circuit_builder() function
    3. Exports to OpenQASM 3.0 via ql.to_openqasm()
    4. Loads into Qiskit and simulates with AerSimulator
    5. Extracts result from measurement counts
    6. Returns (actual, expected) tuple for assertion

    Args:
        circuit_builder: Callable that builds circuit and returns expected result
        width: Bit width of result register to extract
        in_place: If True, result uses full bitstring (for NOT operations).
                 If False (default), result uses first `width` chars of bitstring.

    Returns:
        Callable that returns (actual, expected) tuple

    Example:
