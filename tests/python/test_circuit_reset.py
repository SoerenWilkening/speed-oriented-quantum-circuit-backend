"""Tests for circuit reset behavior via ql.circuit().

Verifies that ql.circuit() properly resets all circuit state:
- No gate leakage from prior operations
- Qubit allocation starts fresh (from index 0)
- Simulation results are independent across resets
- Multiple consecutive resets work correctly
- Reset after conditional operations produces clean state

Important: Always call gc.collect() before ql.circuit() to prevent
GC-induced gate injection from previous test's qint destructors.

Requirement: TEST-04 (circuit state isolation)
